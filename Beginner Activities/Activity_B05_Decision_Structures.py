Program Analysis Activities

1.  This program's 'switch pressed' variables (e.g. SW3_pressed) use
    True or False (Boolean) logic states. Logic states allow multiple
    switch inputs to be combined using the Boolean logical operators
    'and', 'or', and 'not'. For example, changing the conditional
    expression in the program to:
    
    if SW3_pressed and SW4_pressed:
    
    ... will light LED2 only when both SW3 and SW4 are pressed at the
    same time. Modify the if condition in your program to match this
    example and verify its operation.

2.  Replace the 'and' operator in the if condition with 'or' and run
    the program again. Does it work the way you would expect it to?

3.  It's just as easy to invert an input to its opposite state using
    a logical 'not' operator. Predict how you think this conditional
    expression will act:

    if SW3_pressed and not SW4_pressed:

    Try the condition in your program to verify your prediction.

4.  Let's make the program count the number of times SW3 is pressed.
    Start by reverting the if condition back to only reading the
    state of pushbutton SW3. Next, add the 'SW3_presses += 1' compound
    operation to accumulate SW3 presses (it performs the same function
    as 'SW3_presses = SW3_presses + 1', but in a shorter statement):
    
    if SW3_pressed:
        beaper.LED2.value(1)
        SW3_presses += 1
    else:
        beaper.LED2.value(0)

    Next, add this set of if/elif conditions to display the number of
    times SW3 has been pressed using the LEDs:
  
    # Light LEDs for different numbers of presses
    if SW3_presses >= 1:
        beaper.LED3.value(1)
    elif SW3_presses >= 10:
        beaper.LED4.value(1)
    elif SW3_presses >= MAX_COUNT:
        beaper.LED5.value(1)

    How do you think it will work? Run the program and try it. Each
    press of SW3 should light LED2 momentarily, and LED3 should remain
    lit after the first press. Does it? Does LED4 turn on after ten
    presses? Can you explain why?

5.  Previous programs have used the '==' (equal to) conditional
    operator to check if two values are the same. This program uses
    the '>=' (greater than or equal to) conditional operator to check
    if the value of SW3_presses is the same or larger than three
    different fixed numbers.
    
    In MicroPython, any of these six conditional operators can be
    used in if conditions:

    ==  equal to
    !=  not equal to
    <   less than
    >   greater than
    <=  less than or equal to
    >=  greater than or equal to

    The other new feature introduced in the previous step is the
    if/elif (else-if) structure - a chain of multiple conditional
    decisions. Starting with the first if, each condition is evaluated
    in turn until the first true condition is found. Once a true
    condition is found, its code runs and the rest of the chain is
    skipped. If none of the conditions are true, the entire chain is
    bypassed.

    With a better understanding of how the chain works, can you
    explain why LED4 didn't turn on after ten presses in the previous
    step? Re-arrange the conditions in the correct order to light LED3
    after the first press, LED4 after 10 presses, and LED5 after the
    maximum number of presses:

    # Light LEDs for different numbers of presses
    if SW3_presses >= MAX_COUNT:
        beaper.LED5.value(1)
    elif SW3_presses >= 10:
        beaper.LED4.value(1)
    elif SW3_presses >= 1:
        beaper.LED3.value(1)

    Also add a block of code to reset the SW3_presses count and turn
    off the LEDs when SW5 is pressed:

    # Reset the count
    if SW5_pressed:
        SW3_presses = 0
        beaper.LED3.value(0)
        beaper.LED4.value(0)
        beaper.LED5.value(0)
    
    Try these new code blocks in your program. To see exactly what
    is happening, add a print statement inside the 'if SW3_pressed:'
    block to display the count in the console:

    if SW3_pressed:
        beaper.LED2.value(1)
        SW3_presses += 1
        print("SW3_presses:", SW3_presses)

    Watch the console output while pressing and holding SW3. How
    quickly does the count increase? Does this help explain the
    LED behaviour you observed?

6.  You may have noticed in the previous step that the counter
    increases very quickly - much faster than you're actually
    pressing the button. This is because the button state is read
    every loop, so holding SW3 for even a fraction of a second will
    register dozens of counts.

    The solution is edge detection - only counting a new press when
    the button transitions from not-pressed to pressed. The program
    already declares SW3_last for exactly this purpose. Here is how
    to use it:

    # Detect a new SW3 press (not-pressed to pressed transition)
    if SW3_pressed and not SW3_last:
        SW3_presses += 1
        beaper.LED2.value(1)
    else:
        beaper.LED2.value(0)

    The key is that SW3_last must be updated at the end of each loop
    cycle, after all the button logic has run, so it correctly holds
    the previous loop's button state:

    # Save button states for next loop
    SW3_last = SW3_pressed

    Add both of these changes to your program. The print statement
    from the previous step will now show exactly one count per press
    in the console, regardless of how long the button is held. This
    is a good example of using print to verify that a fix is working
    correctly - once you're satisfied, the print statement can be
    removed or commented out.

    The SW4_last variable is also already declared for the same
    purpose. Can you add edge detection for SW4 as well?


Programming Activities

1.  Modify the press-counting program from the analysis activities
    so that pressing SW3 increases the count and pressing SW4
    decreases it, with the count clamped so that it can never go
    below zero or above MAX_COUNT. Use the LEDs to show four ranges
    of the count value (off, low, medium, high).

2.  Create a program that uses SW3 and SW4 as 'up' and 'down' buttons
    to scroll through four different LED patterns, one per button
    press. Pressing SW3 should advance to the next pattern, and
    pressing SW4 should go back to the previous one. The sequence
    should wrap around (going past the last pattern returns to the
    first, and going before the first returns to the last).

3.  Create a two-player rapid-clicker game in which the first player
    to reach MAX_COUNT clicks wins. Here is how the game should work:

    - Player 1 uses SW3, and LED2 flashes momentarily on each of their clicks
    - Player 2 uses SW4, and LED5 flashes momentarily on each of their clicks
    - The first player to reach MAX_COUNT wins
    - If Player 1 wins, LED3 lights up and stays on
    - If Player 2 wins, LED4 lights up and stays on
    - Once a player has won, additional button presses from either
      player should be blocked until the game is reset
    - Pressing SW5 resets both counters, turns off all LEDs, and
      restarts the game

    Hint: You will need to track whether the game is still active so
    that you can block input once a winner is found. A Boolean
    variable works well for this. Start with something like:

SW3_presses = 0
SW4_presses = 0
SW3_last = False
SW4_last = False
game_active = True

    Use edge detection (from Analysis Q6) for both SW3 and SW4 so
    that each physical press is counted exactly once. Wrap all of the
    player input and win-checking logic inside an 'if game_active:'
    block, and handle the SW5 reset outside of it so that the reset
    always works.

    While developing and testing your game, a print statement is a
    useful way to track both counters at once without needing to watch
    the LEDs:

    print("P1:", SW3_presses, "P2:", SW4_presses)

    Once your game is working correctly, remove or comment out any
    print statements so they don't slow down the program. To comment
    out a line in MicroPython, add a '#' character at the start:

    # print("P1:", SW3_presses, "P2:", SW4_presses)
