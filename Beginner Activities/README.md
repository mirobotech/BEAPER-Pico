# BEAPER Pico Beginner Activities

Beginner programming activities designed to introduce novices to microcontroller
programming using MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico using the BEAPER Pico circuit,
with the aim of providing learners with the requisite knowledge to create their
own, fully-featured simple projects such as a Simon-style memory game, a reaction
timer game, a room alarm, a servo driver, an autonomous line-following robot, or
a simple classroom Sumo robot.

These beginner activities combine easy to understand starter code with heavily
scaffolded program analysis and extension activities to introduce and reinforce
fundamental programming concepts. They are designed to be used in an early high
school level computer technology class and can also be an introductory self-study
course for use with BEAPER Pico.

# Planned Activities

## Activity 1 - Output

Learn how a microcontroller program makes something happen.

## Activity 2 - Timing (blocking)

Control when something happens.

## Activity 3 - Data: Constants and Variables

Store, remember, and use values.

## Activity 4 - Digital Input

Let the user control what happens.

## Activity 5 - Decision Structures

More complex ways to control what happens.

## Activity 6 - Conditional Loops

Repeating actions while conditions are true.

## Activity 7 - Counted Loops

Repeating actions a specific number of times.

## Activity 8 - Functions (parameter passing)

Naming and re-using common actions.

## Activity 9 - Analog Input

Measure and respond to real-world inputs.

## Activity 10 - Analog Output (PWM)

Control real-world outputs.

## Activity 11 - Non-Blocking Timing

Enable more than one action simultaneously.

## Activity 12 - State Machines

Simplify program tasks into modes of operation.

## System Design Challenge

Incorporate all of your learning into a simple project such as:

* Simon-style memory game
* Room alarm system with secret arm/disarm code
* Reaction timer game
* Simple robots (line-follower, classroom Sumo)
* Simple servo driver
* Analog sensor/monitor and controller
