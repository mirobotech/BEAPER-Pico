# BEAPER Pico Beginner Activities

Beginner programming activities designed to introduce novices to microcontroller
programming using MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico using the BEAPER Pico circuit,
with the aim of providing learners with the requisite knowledge to create their
own, fully-featured simple projects such as a Simon-style memory game, a reaction
timer game, a room alarm, a servo driver, an autonomous line-following robot, or
a simple classroom Sumo robot.

These beginner activities combine easy to understand starter code with heavily
scaffolded program analysis and extension activities to introduce and reinforce
fundamental programming concepts. They are designed to be used in an early high
school level computer technology class and can also be an introductory self-study
course for use with BEAPER Pico.

# Planned Activities

## Activity 1 - Output

Focus: Learning how a microcontroller program makes something happen.

## Activity 2 - Timing (blocking)

Focus: Controlling when or how long something happens.

## Activity 3 - Digital Input

Focus: Reacting to an external input.

## Activity 4 - Data: Constants and Variables

Focus: Remembering and using values.

## Activity 5 - Decision Structures

Focus: Making decisions using logic and comparisons.

## Activity 6 - Conditional Loops

Focus: Repeating actions while conditions are true.

## Activity 7 - Counted Loops

Focus: Repeating actions a known number of times.

## Activity 8 - Functions (parameter passing)

Focus: Naming and re-using common actions.

## Activity 9 - Analog Input

Focus: Measuring and responding to real-world inputs.

## Activity 10 - Analog Output (PWM)

Focus: Controlling real-world outputs.

## Activity 11 - Non-Blocking Timing

Focus: Doing more than one thing at a time.

## Activity 12 - State Machines

Focus: Simplifying program tasks into modes of operation.

## System Design Challenge

Incorporating all of the learning into a simple project such as:

* Simon-style memory game
* Room alarm system with secret arm/disarm code
* Reaction timer game
* Simple robots (line-follower, classroom Sumo)
* Simple servo driver
* Analog sensor/monitor and controller
