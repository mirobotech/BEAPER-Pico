# ================================================================================
# Guided Exploration
# ================================================================================
#
# Activities 9 and 10 used a fixed 'STEP_DELAY' to control the main
# loop rate, and all outputs - LED dimming, fading, pot reads - were
# tied to the same delay. While this works well for simple programs,
# Activity 10 GE5 and GE7 identified a fundamental problem: if any
# action within the loop slows down, every other part also slows down.
#
# This activity introduces non-blocking timing. Rather than pausing
# the whole program with 'sleep_ms()', the loop continuously checks
# and sets timestamps to decide when each action is due. The first
# part detects tap-versus hold on a single button, and the second
# part blinks two LEDs simultaneously at different rates - both tasks
# that would be impossible using fixed time delays. All responsive
# programs implement similar techniques.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 1 - Why this activity needs a faster loop
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every program since Activity 2 has used 'time.sleep_ms()' to
# control how fast the main loop runs. Activity 9 set STEP_DELAY
# to 100ms; Activity 10 set it to 20ms, making that loop run
# approximately 50 times per second.
#
# This activity sets LOOP_DELAY to 1ms - the loop runs approximately
# 1000 times per second. Why does this activity need a much faster
# loop rate than previous activities?
#
# More fundamentally: in Activity 10, the fade rate was coupled to
# STEP_DELAY. Look at this activity's loop. If you added a sensor
# read that takes 50ms to execute, would the blink rates be affected?
# Why? What would need to change to make the blink rates truly
# independent of all other code in the loop?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 2 - time.ticks_diff() and counter rollover
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The timing pattern used throughout this program follows the same
# structure every time:
#
# Example code:
#
# current_time = time.ticks_ms()
# if time.ticks_diff(current_time, last_event_time) >= INTERVAL:
#   last_event_time = current_time
#   # take action
#
# MicroPython provides 'time.ticks_diff()' to subtract time values
# instead of simply subtracting timestamps. To understand why this
# function is necessary, consider what happens to 'time.ticks_ms()'
# after the microcontroller has been running for a long time. The
# count is stored as a fixed-size integer and eventually has to
# rollover, or wrap back to zero. MicroPython's time.ticks_diff()
# function handles the rollover correctly.
#
# Try evaluating these expressions in the MicroPython console,
# imagining that 'last_event_time' was recorded when the counter
# read 1073741698 and 'current_time' is 100 (the counter has just
# rolled over):
#
# Example code:
#
# import time
# time.ticks_diff(100, 1073741698)
#
# What result do you get? Now try plain subtraction:
#
# Example code:
#
# 100 - 1073741698
#
# 'time.ticks_diff()' returns the correct positive elapsed time,
# accounting for rollover. Plain subtraction gives a large negative
# number, which would cause the '>= INTERVAL' check to never trigger,
# breaking all timing in the program.
#
# 'time.ticks_diff(new, old)' is designed specifically to handle
# rollover correctly. Always use it instead of subtracting ticks
# values directly.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 3 - Tracing the button hold state machine
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The button hold detection uses three variables: 'button_is_down',
# 'button_down_time', and 'hold_fired'. Trace through the program
# carefully for each of these three scenarios and record the state
# of all three variables at each step:
#
# Scenario A - Quick tap (button held less than HOLD_TIME):
# - Button goes down
# - Button released after 200ms
#
# Scenario B - Hold (button held longer than HOLD_TIME):
# - Button goes down
# - 500ms elapses
# - Button released after 800ms total
#
# Scenario C - Long hold (button held much longer than HOLD_TIME):
# - Button goes down
# - 500ms elapses (hold fires)
# - 1000ms elapses
# - Button released after 1500ms total
#
# Why are both 'button_is_down' and 'button_down_time' needed
# as separate variables? 'button_is_down' tells the program
# whether the button is currently held. 'button_down_time'
# records when it went down so the hold duration can be
# measured. Each variable has one clear responsibility.
#
# Why is 'hold_fired' necessary? What would happen in Scenario C
# if 'hold_fired' were not used and the hold action had no
# guard condition?
#
# Notice that in a tap, LED2 changes on button release rather
# than on button press. This is essential for tap-vs-hold
# detection - why? Could you detect a tap on button press
# instead, and what information would you need that is not
# available at that moment?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 4 - Multi-rate blinking and toggle vs. blink rate
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Part 2 blinks LED4 and LED5 at different rates simultaneously.
# Both LEDs share the same main loop, but each has its own
# timestamp and interval constant.
#
# LED4 toggles every BLINK4_INTERVAL milliseconds (200ms). A
# full blink cycle - on, then off again - takes two toggles,
# so 200ms per toggle means 400ms per full cycle: a blink rate
# of 2.5 Hz, not 5 Hz. LED5 toggles every BLINK5_INTERVAL
# milliseconds (350ms), for a blink rate of approximately
# 1.4 Hz. Since these rates are not simple multiples of each
# other, the LEDs drift in and out of phase, sometimes toggling
# close together, sometimes far apart.
#
# Calculate when LED4 and LED5 will next toggle at the same
# time (within one loop iteration), starting from the moment
# both are initialised. This is the least common multiple of
# their intervals. After this time, does the pattern repeat?
#
# The program uses '>=' rather than '==' to compare elapsed
# time against the interval. Explain why '==' would fail
# almost every time, even with a 1ms loop delay. What does
# this mean for the actual accuracy of the blink interval -
# if BLINK4_INTERVAL is 200ms and the loop runs every 1ms,
# what is the worst-case timing error for each toggle?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 5 - Repeating interval vs. one-shot elapsed time
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Look at the two timing patterns side by side:
#
# Button hold detection:
# 'button_down_time' is set once when the button goes down, and
# the elapsed time is checked every iteration while the button
# remains held. The important value is the elapsed time from
# the start to the end of the button press - a one-shot event.
#
# LED blinking:
# 'last_blink4_time' is updated each time the LED toggles, and
# the elapsed time is checked every iteration unconditionally.
# The time is reset every event, and used to set the interval
# until the next blink - a periodic, repeating event.
#
# This distinction - a one-shot elapsed time versus a repeating
# interval - covers the majority of non-blocking timing needs
# in embedded programs. In Activity 12 you will see how these
# patterns combine with program state to produce more complex
# timed behaviours.
#
# Identify which pattern (repeating or one-shot) would be most
# appropriate for each of these timing needs:
# a) A status LED that blinks once per second indefinitely
# b) A timeout that triggers if no button is pressed for 30s
# c) A motor that runs for exactly 2 seconds when SW3 is pressed
# d) A sensor read every 500ms regardless of other activity


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# These activities build on the one-shot and repeating timing
# patterns adding additional real-world features to the example
# program above. EA5 is the exception - it opens a separate
# skeleton file that reimplements Activity 10's analog output
# using the techniques from this activity.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Debouncing SW3 with timing
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Mechanical buttons produce multiple rapid transitions (bounces)
# when pressed, which can register as multiple presses. This
# exercise first lets you see bounce directly, then fixes it.
#
# Part 1 - See the bounce:
#
# Declare a 'raw_count' variable starting at 0, and an 'sw3_last'
# Boolean variable to track the previous reading. In the main loop,
# detect a new press using simple edge detection (no debounce yet)
# and increment raw_count:
#
# Example code:
#
# sw3_current = beaper.SW3.value() == 0
# if sw3_current and not sw3_last:
#   raw_count += 1
#   print("Raw count:", raw_count)
# sw3_last = sw3_current
#
# Press SW3 once, firmly but normally. Does raw_count increase by
# exactly 1? Try several presses. Try pressing the button more
# gently and forcefully. Some presses may register as 2 or more,
# depending on your specific switch - this is mechanical bounce
# being detected as separate presses.
#
# Part 2 - Add debouncing:
#
# A software debounce ignores transitions that occur within
# DEBOUNCE_MS of the previous transition. Declare a 'last_sw3_change'
# timestamp, a 'sw3_state' variable to track the last stable state,
# and a 'debounced_count' variable:
#
# Example code:
#
# current_sw3 = beaper.SW3.value()
# if (current_sw3 != sw3_state and
#     time.ticks_diff(current_time, last_sw3_change) >= DEBOUNCE_MS):
#   sw3_state = current_sw3
#   last_sw3_change = current_time
#   if sw3_state == 0:
#     debounced_count += 1
#     print("Raw:", raw_count, "  Debounced:", debounced_count)
#
# Keep both counters running side by side and press SW3 several
# times. Does debounced_count now match the number of times you
# actually pressed the button, even when raw_count shows extra
# bounces?
#
# Try DEBOUNCE_MS values of 10, 20, 50, and 100ms and observe the
# difference in responsiveness and reliability. What is the minimum
# debounce time that eliminates false triggers on your hardware?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Inactivity timeout
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement an inactivity timeout that turns LED2 and LED3 off after
# a time-out delay, and turns them back on when a button is pressed.
#
# Declare a 'last_activity_time' timestamp that resets to
# 'current_time' whenever any button is pressed. Set TIMEOUT_MS with
# an appropriate time-out value (say 10s, but in milliseconds).
# If TIMEOUT_MS elapses with no button activity, enter an idle state:
# turn off LED2 and LED3, print a timeout message, and blink the
# status LED slowly (say once per second) instead of leaving it
# solidly on using the same multi-rate technique from Part 2, just
# applied to a new LED at a slower interval. The next button press
# should turn the status LED solidly back on, restore normal
# LED2/LED3 operation, and reset the timeout.
#
# You will need a 'timed_out' boolean, a 'last_heartbeat_time'
# timestamp, and a HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL constant. Only run the
# heartbeat logic while 'timed_out' is True:
#
# Example code:
#
# if timed_out:
#   if time.ticks_diff(current_time, last_heartbeat_time) >= HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL:
#     beaper.pico_led_toggle()
#     last_heartbeat_time = current_time
#
# Notice that LED4 and LED5 keep blinking at their own rates
# throughout, completely unaffected by the timeout - a direct
# demonstration that independent timers really are independent,
# even when a new one (the heartbeat) is added alongside them.
#
# What TIMEOUT_MS value feels natural for a bench instrument that
# should indicate it is idle? How does this pattern relate to the
# screen-off timers used in battery-powered devices? Why does a
# slow blink communicate "idle" more clearly than turning the LED
# off completely?
#
# As a further challenge: reconfigure the status LED as a PWM
# output (Activity 10) and slowly breathe its brightness up and
# down during timeout, rather than blinking it on and off. This
# combines this activity's independent timers with Activity 10's
# PWM output - a preview of how non-blocking timing can drive
# smoothly varying effects, not just on/off toggling.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - One-shot timed signal
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement a one-shot timed signal. When SW4 is pressed, LED2
# lights for exactly SIGNAL_MS milliseconds then turns off
# automatically, without using 'time.sleep_ms()'. If SW4 is
# pressed again while the signal is active, restart the timer
# from the new press time.
#
# You will need a 'signal_active' boolean and a 'signal_start_time'
# timestamp. Each loop iteration checks whether the signal is active
# and whether SIGNAL_MS has elapsed:
#
# Example code:
#
# if signal_active:
#   if time.ticks_diff(current_time, signal_start_time) >= SIGNAL_MS:
#     signal_active = False
#     beaper.LED2.value(0)
#
# Try SIGNAL_MS values of 100, 500, and 2000ms. Notice that at 2000ms
# the main loop continues running normally during the signal - SW2's
# tap-and-hold still works, and LED4 and LED5 continue blinking.
# This would be impossible with 'time.sleep_ms(2000)'.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Independent timing for a slow sensor read
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add independent timing for a slow sensor read alongside the
# fast timing already in the loop. Declare a 'last_temp_time'
# timestamp and a TEMP_INTERVAL constant of 5000ms. Each time
# TEMP_INTERVAL elapses, read 'beaper.mcu_temperature()' and print
# the result.
#
# The button and blink timing should be completely unaffected
# by the sensor read. Verify this by observing the blink rates
# and hold detection while the sensor reading prints every five
# seconds.
#
# Now temporarily add 'time.sleep_ms(50)' inside the sensor
# read block and observe what happens to the blink rates and
# hold sensitivity. This demonstrates concretely why blocking
# calls anywhere in the loop affect all timing in the loop.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - LED Controller Project
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Re-implement Activity 10's analog output controls using
# independent non-blocking timers.
# Open: B11_LED_Controller_Project.py
#
# This skeleton applies the timing patterns from this activity
# to the PWM brightness controls from Activity 10. Each control
# gets its own update rate, independent of the others - the
# dim rate for LED2, the fade step rate for LED3, and the
# pot-polling rate for LED4/LED5 can all be set separately.
