# Beginner Activity 12: State Machines [Activity_B12_State_Machines.py]
# Version: 1.2
# Updated: September 22, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# This program uses a state machine to implement a three-button
# combination lock, styled after a digital hotel safe lock. SW2, SW3,
# and SW4 can be pressed at each step to enter the code. Each press
# beeps and lights the next progress LED. After all three presses
# have been entered, the program checks whether they matched the
# correct combination (SW2, SW3, SW4, in that order). SW5 restarts
# code entry from any state except UNLOCKED.
#
# State diagram:
#   ENTRY_1 --(any button)--> ENTRY_2
#   ENTRY_2 --(any button)--> ENTRY_3
#   ENTRY_3 --(any button, correct sequence)--> UNLOCKED
#   ENTRY_3 --(any button, wrong sequence)   --> ALARM
#   ALARM --(3 alarm beeps complete)--> ENTRY_1
#   Any state except UNLOCKED --(SW5)--> ENTRY_1
#
# Outputs per state:
#   ENTRY_1:  LED2 on (ready, no digits entered)
#   ENTRY_2:  LED2 + LED3 on (one digit entered)
#   ENTRY_3:  LED2 + LED3 + LED4 on (two digits entered)
#   UNLOCKED: LED5 on, beep (access granted)
#   ALARM:    LED2-LED5 flashing, 3 beeps, then returns to ENTRY_1

# ================================================================================
# Guided Exploration
# ================================================================================
#
# Activities 9 through 11 focused on a single technical problem at a
# time: analog input, output, and non-blocking timing. Each activity's
# program grew more capable, but the overall structure stayed the
# same - a loop that checks conditions and updates outputs directly.
# This works well when a program's behaviour depends only on its
# current inputs, but breaks down when a program needs to behave
# differently depending on what has happened before. For example,
# the same button could mean something different depending what part
# of the program is currently running.
#
# This activity introduces state machines: a way of organising a
# program around a set of named states, with explicit rules for when
# to move between them, and what to do while each state is active.
# You have actually built a similar combination lock program twice
# before - as a step-counter in Activity 6, and refactored with
# functions in Activity 8. This activity solves the same problem a
# third time as a proper state machine, allowing you to compare all
# three approaches directly.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 1 - The state diagram
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A state machine can be described visually using a state diagram:
# circles represent states and arrows represent transitions between
# them. Each arrow is labelled with the event that triggers it.
#
# Draw the state diagram for this program. Your diagram should
# have five circles (ENTRY_1, ENTRY_2, ENTRY_3, UNLOCKED, ALARM)
# and an arrow for every transition described in the header
# comment.
#
# Compare your diagram to the state machine section of the main
# loop. Can you find a direct correspondence between each arrow in
# your diagram and a specific 'elif' branch in the code?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 2 - Named state constants
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# States are defined using named integer constants:
#
# Example code:
#
# STATE_ENTRY_1  = const(0)
# STATE_ENTRY_2  = const(1)
# STATE_ENTRY_3  = const(2)
# STATE_UNLOCKED = const(3)
# STATE_ALARM    = const(4)
#
# The program could instead use raw numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) directly
# in the 'if' statements. What would be lost? Consider what happens
# if you need to insert a new state between ENTRY_2 and ENTRY_3 and
# must renumber the existing states.
#
# Named constants also make the serial output meaningful. The
# 'enter_state()' function uses a dictionary to look up the state
# name for printing. What would the output look like if raw numbers
# were used instead of names?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 3 - enter_state() and centralized transitions
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every state transition goes through 'enter_state()' rather than
# setting 'state' directly. This function clears every output
# before setting the new state, resetting 'flash_on', 'beep_on',
# and 'alarm_beep_count' at the same time. Each caller then turns
# on only what the new state needs.
#
# Compare this to an alternative design where every state's
# outputs are checked and set fresh on every single loop
# iteration, regardless of whether the state just changed. What
# would be different about the program's behaviour, readability,
# and efficiency?
#
# Why does 'enter_state()' reset 'alarm_beep_count' to 0 even
# though it is only used inside STATE_ALARM? What would happen on
# the second time the lock enters ALARM if this reset were
# missing?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 4 - Reading buttons: read_button() and wait_for_release()
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Reading the buttons uses two small functions:
#
# Example code:
#
# def read_button():
#   if beaper.SW2.value() == 0:
#     return 2
#   elif beaper.SW3.value() == 0:
#     return 3
#   elif beaper.SW4.value() == 0:
#     return 4
#   else:
#     return 0
#
# def wait_for_release():
#   while beaper.SW2.value() == 0 or beaper.SW3.value() == 0 or beaper.SW4.value() == 0:
#     pass
#
# 'read_button()' uses the same 'beaper.SWx.value() == 0' check
# you have used since Activity 3 - nothing new there. The only new
# idea is 'wait_for_release()': once a press is detected and
# recorded, the program deliberately pauses until the button is
# physically released, before continuing.
#
# Why is this necessary? Consider what would happen without
# 'wait_for_release()' if a press were held down for 300ms: at
# LOOP_DELAY = 10ms, how many loop iterations would that span, and
# what would 'entered_1' end up containing after all of them?
#
# This pattern - detect a press, then wait for release before
# continuing - is a simplified version of 'read_keypad()' from
# Activity 8, which did the same thing across all four buttons.
# Compare the two: what does 'read_keypad()' do that
# 'read_button()' plus 'wait_for_release()' does not?
#
# Note that 'wait_for_release()' blocks the program - it is not
# the non-blocking style from Activity 11. Why is blocking
# acceptable here but not in STATE_ALARM below? Think about what
# else the program needs to keep doing while each state is active.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 5 - Tracing the happy path
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Trace through the "happy path" - the sequence of transitions
# when the combination is entered correctly:
#
# Example code:
#
# Start in ENTRY_1
# Press SW2 --> ENTRY_2 (entered_1 = 2)
# Press SW3 --> ENTRY_3 (entered_2 = 3)
# Press SW4 --> UNLOCKED (entered_3 = 4, all three correct)
#
# For each transition, identify: which 'elif' branch handles it,
# which LEDs turn on, and what gets printed to the console. Run
# the program and verify your trace against the actual serial
# output.
#
# Now trace an incorrect attempt: SW3, SW2, SW4. Which state does
# each press lead to? Is anything different about how ENTRY_2 and
# ENTRY_3 behave for this attempt compared to the correct one, or
# do they behave identically until the final check?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 6 - Why check the whole combination at once
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Notice that pressing a wrong button during ENTRY_1 or ENTRY_2
# does not trigger the alarm immediately - it is simply recorded
# and the program moves on to the next entry state, exactly as if
# it were correct. The combination is only checked once, after
# all three presses have been entered, in STATE_ENTRY_3.
#
# Why might this be a better design than checking each button as
# it is pressed and triggering the alarm on the first wrong one?
# Think about someone trying to guess the combination by trial and
# error: what could they learn from a lock that reveals which
# specific digit was wrong, that they could not learn from a lock
# that only reveals whether the whole sequence was right or wrong?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 7 - Independent timers inside the alarm state
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The ALARM state contains two independent repeating timers
# running simultaneously - the same multi-rate timing pattern
# from Activity 11, but now happening inside a single state
# rather than across the whole program:
#
# - 'last_flash_time' controls when the LEDs toggle, at
#   FLASH_INTERVAL.
# - 'last_beep_time' controls when the beep toggles, using two
#   different intervals depending on 'beep_on': ALARM_BEEP_ON
#   while beeping, ALARM_BEEP_OFF while silent.
#
# Trace through several iterations of the loop while in
# STATE_ALARM and verify that the flash and beep timers advance
# independently - one does not wait for or reset the other.
#
# 'alarm_beep_count' increments each time a beep finishes (when
# 'beep_on' changes from True to False). Once it reaches
# ALARM_BEEP_COUNT, the program calls 'enter_state(STATE_ENTRY_1,
# ...)' - from inside the alarm-handling code itself, not from a
# button press. What does this tell you about what can trigger a
# state transition? Must it always be a button press?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 8 - Comparing three versions of the same lock
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# You have now seen three variations of the same combination lock:
# a step-counter with 'if attempts == 1: ... elif attempts == 2:'
# logic in Activity 6, a version refactored to use functions in
# Activity 8, and now this state machine version - which also
# behaves differently, checking the whole combination at once
# rather than rejecting on the first wrong button.
#
# Compare all three versions (open your earlier files if you
# still have them). What does naming the states explicitly add
# that the attempts-counter versions did not have? Is there
# anything the earlier versions did more simply? A state machine
# is a tool, not always the best tool - when would a simple
# counter be preferable to a full state machine?
#
#
# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Hold-to-relock from UNLOCKED
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The UNLOCKED state currently does nothing useful after the
# lock opens - LED5 stays on indefinitely. Implement a re-lock
# mechanism: SW5 must be held for RESET_HOLD_TIME milliseconds
# to re-lock. Use the 'button_is_down' and 'button_down_time'
# pattern from Activity 11.
#
# Why require a hold rather than a tap to re-lock? Think about
# what would happen in a real access-control system if the door
# accidentally re-locked while someone was passing through.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Lockout after failed attempts
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a lockout after three failed attempts. Declare an
# 'attempt_count' variable that increments each time the lock
# transitions to ALARM (which only happens from STATE_ENTRY_3).
# After three failed attempts, enter a LOCKOUT state that ignores
# all input for LOCKOUT_TIME milliseconds before returning to
# ENTRY_1.
#
# Add LOCKOUT to your state diagram and identify the new
# transitions. How does this change the security of the lock
# compared to the version with no lockout?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - A four-button combination
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Extend the lock to a four-button combination. Add a
# 'CORRECT_4' constant, an 'entered_4' variable, and a new
# 'STATE_ENTRY_4' state following the same pattern as
# ENTRY_1 through ENTRY_3. Update the state diagram and the
# final check in what is now STATE_ENTRY_4 to compare all four
# entered values.
#
# What did you have to change in how many places to add one more
# digit? A fully flexible version - supporting any combination
# length without adding a new state and a new variable for each
# digit - would store the combination as a list and use a loop
# with an index variable instead. Lists and indexing are covered
# in the intermediate activities; for now, four independent
# variables is a reasonable way to extend this design by one step.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Designing a security alarm capstone
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Consider how this combination lock could form the arm/disarm
# mechanism for a security alarm capstone project. What would
# the full system's state diagram look like, including:
# - Disarmed state (lock is open, sensors ignored)
# - Arming state (countdown delay while you leave)
# - Armed state (sensors active)
# - Triggered state (alarm sounding)
# - Each combination lock state for disarming
#
# Draw the complete state diagram. How many states does the
# full system have? How does the lock's state machine nest
# inside the alarm system's state machine?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Traffic Light Controller
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Apply what you have learned to a different kind of state
# machine - one driven mostly by elapsed time rather than button
# presses, with events (a simulated car and pedestrian) setting
# flags that are checked later rather than triggering an immediate
# transition. Open: B12_Traffic_Light_Controller_Project.py
#
# This project is a skeleton, not a finished program - re-read
# GE1 through GE7 before starting, since the traffic light reuses
# the same enter_state() and named-constant patterns as the
# combination lock above.
