Capstone Project: Simon Memory Game [BEAPER_Pico-Capstone_Simon_Game.py]
April 21, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Hardware used:
    SW2 / LED2 - Button and LED 1 (e.g. green)
    SW3 / LED3 - Button and LED 2 (e.g. red)
    SW4 / LED4 - Button and LED 3 (e.g. yellow)
    SW5 / LED5 - Button and LED 4 (e.g. blue)
    LS1        - Piezo speaker (one distinct tone per button)

Compatible with all BEAPER Nano configurations. No additional
hardware or jumper changes required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game rules:
    The game plays back a growing sequence of flashing LEDs with tones.
    The player repeats the sequence by pressing the matching buttons.
    Each correct round adds one more step to the sequence.
    A wrong button press or timeout ends the game.
    Press any button during the idle animation to start a new game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin - complete your capstone plan:
    1. Write a plain-English description of the game from the player's
          perspective (what they see, hear, and do).
    2. List all states and draw your state diagram.
    3. Complete the state details table (outputs, transitions, next states).
    4. List all constants and variables you will need.
    5. Write your testing plan before writing any code.

Capstone Development Guide

Work through these steps in order. Complete each step and test it
before moving on to the next.

Step 1 - Idle animation
  Implement the attract animation in STATE_IDLE. The pattern should
  cycle through the four LEDs using idle_step and the IDLE_INTERVAL
  timer. Test that pressing any button transitions to the first
  playback state and stops the animation.

Step 2 - Single step playback
  Implement STATE_PLAYBACK and STATE_GAP for a sequence of length 1.
  Verify that pressing the correct button produces a correct-press
  flash, and that pressing the wrong button transitions to GAME_OVER.
  Check the serial output to confirm state transitions are printing
  correctly.

Step 3 - Full playback sequence
  Extend the playback logic to handle sequences longer than 1. Use
  play_index to advance through the sequence. After all steps are
  shown, transition to STATE_WAITING with input_index = 0.

Step 4 - Player input and correct sequence
  Implement STATE_WAITING and STATE_CORRECT. After each correct press
  advance input_index. When input_index reaches seq_length, the round
  is complete - add a new step and begin playback of the longer sequence.

Step 5 - Game over and score
  Implement STATE_GAME_OVER with a clear failure sound/animation that
  is distinct from the correct-press feedback. Implement display_score()
  in a way that makes the score clear. Return to STATE_IDLE afterward.

Step 6 - Difficulty and polish (extensions)
  Consider these improvements once the core game works:

  a) Adjustable speed: decrease SHOW_TIME and GAP_TIME as the sequence
     grows longer, making later rounds harder. How will you calculate
     the speed from the current sequence length?

  b) High score: track the best score across multiple games in a
     variable that persists between STATE_GAME_OVER and STATE_IDLE.
     Display it at the start of each game.

  c) Strict mode: add a penalty for pressing a button at the wrong
     time (during playback). How does this affect your state machine?
     Which states need to check for unexpected button presses?

  d) Sound design: are the four tones clearly distinguishable on your
     hardware? Try adjusting TONES to find four pitches that sound
     natural together. The traditional Simon tones are E4, C#5, A3, 
     and E3, but these have been moved up an octave to E5, C#5, A4,
     and E4 (659 Hz, 554 Hz, 440 Hz, 330 Hz) so they sound better
     when played on the circuit's small piezo speaker.
