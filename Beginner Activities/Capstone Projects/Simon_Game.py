# Capstone Project: Simon Memory Game [Simon_Game.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2 / LED2 - Button and LED 1 (e.g. green)
#   SW3 / LED3 - Button and LED 2 (e.g. red)
#   SW4 / LED4 - Button and LED 3 (e.g. yellow)
#   SW5 / LED5 - Button and LED 4 (e.g. blue)
#   LS1        - Piezo speaker (one distinct tone per button)
#
# Compatible with all BEAPER Pico configurations. No additional
# hardware or jumper changes required.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Game rules:
#   The game plays back a growing sequence of flashing LEDs with tones.
#   The player repeats the sequence by pressing the matching buttons.
#   Each correct round adds one more step to the sequence.
#   A wrong button press or timeout ends the game.
#   Completing the maximum sequence length (MAX_LENGTH) wins the game.
#   Press any button during the idle animation to start a new game.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This capstone introduces two new data structures: tuples and lists.
# Both hold multiple related values under one name, indexed by position
# (starting at 0) - but they behave differently once created. Read the
# Development Guide's Step 1 before starting, since every other step
# depends on understanding this distinction.
#
# Before you begin - complete your capstone plan using the Capstone
# Preparation Guide: project description, state diagram, state
# details table, constants and variables, and testing plan.

# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order. Complete each step and test it
# before moving on to the next.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Understanding lists and tuples
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every activity up to this point stored related values in separate
# named variables - Activity 12's combination lock used entered_1,
# entered_2, entered_3, entered_4 for a four-digit code. That works
# well for a small, fixed number of values, but Simon's sequence can
# grow up to MAX_LENGTH (16) steps. Writing entered_1 through
# entered_16, with a 16-way if/elif chain to read the right one,
# would be unwieldy - and would need rewriting entirely if MAX_LENGTH
# ever changed. This capstone uses two new constructs instead.
#
# A TUPLE is an ordered collection of values, indexed starting at 0,
# written with parentheses:
#
# Example code:
#
# BUTTONS = (beaper.SW2, beaper.SW3, beaper.SW4, beaper.SW5)
#
# BUTTONS[0] is beaper.SW2, BUTTONS[1] is beaper.SW3, and so on.
# Once created, a tuple's size is fixed, and you cannot assign a new
# value to one of its positions - BUTTONS[0] = beaper.SW3 would raise
# an error. This program uses three tuples - BUTTONS, LEDS, and
# TONES - as parallel lookups: button index 2 (SW4) always
# corresponds to LEDS[2] (LED4) and TONES[2] (440 Hz). This is a
# natural fit for a tuple, because the mapping between buttons, LEDs,
# and tones never changes while the program runs.
#
# A LIST looks similar but is written with square brackets, and -
# unlike a tuple - its elements CAN be changed after creation:
#
# Example code:
#
# sequence = [0] * MAX_LENGTH
#
# This creates a list of 16 zeros: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
# 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Unlike the tuples above, individual elements of
# 'sequence' change throughout the game:
#
# Example code:
#
# sequence[seq_length] = random.randint(0, 3)
#
# This is the core reason Simon's sequence needs a list rather than a
# tuple: each round, a new random step is written into the next
# available position. A tuple could not do this - you would need to
# build an entirely new tuple every time a step is added, which is
# both awkward and wasteful. Use a tuple when a fixed collection of
# values will not change; use a list when individual elements need
# to be updated after creation.
#
# Both are read the same way - square brackets with an index:
# BUTTONS[i], LEDS[i], sequence[i]. Trace through 'add_step()' and
# 'show_step()' and confirm you can predict what each line does
# before continuing.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Idle animation
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the attract animation in STATE_IDLE. The pattern should
# cycle through the four LEDs using idle_step and the IDLE_INTERVAL
# timer. Test that pressing any button transitions to the first
# playback state and stops the animation.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Single step playback
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement STATE_PLAYBACK and STATE_GAP for a sequence of length 1.
# Verify that pressing the correct button produces a correct-press
# flash, and that pressing the wrong button transitions to GAME_OVER.
# Check the Serial output to confirm state transitions are printing
# correctly.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Full playback sequence
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Extend the playback logic to handle sequences longer than 1. Use
# play_index to advance through the sequence. After all steps are
# shown, transition to STATE_WAITING with input_index = 0.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Player input and correct sequence
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement STATE_WAITING and STATE_CORRECT. After each correct press
# advance input_index. When input_index reaches seq_length, the round
# is complete - call add_step() and begin playback of the longer
# sequence, unless add_step() returns False (MAX_LENGTH reached).
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6 - Winning and losing
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement STATE_GAME_OVER with a clear failure sound/animation that
# is distinct from the correct-press feedback - and a distinct sound
# for winning (reaching MAX_LENGTH) versus losing (wrong press or
# timeout). Test both endings deliberately: losing is easy to test by
# pressing a wrong button, but reaching MAX_LENGTH requires either
# genuine skill or temporarily lowering MAX_LENGTH for testing.
# Implement display_score() in a way that makes the score clear.
# Return to STATE_IDLE afterward.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 7 - Difficulty and polish
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Once the core game works end to end, move on to the Extension
# Activities below for ideas on making the game more challenging or
# more polished.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Adjustable speed
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Decrease SHOW_TIME and GAP_TIME as the sequence grows longer,
# making later rounds harder. How will you calculate the speed from
# the current sequence length?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - High score
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Track the best score across multiple games in a variable that
# persists between STATE_GAME_OVER and STATE_IDLE. Display it at the
# start of each game.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Strict mode
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a penalty for pressing a button at the wrong time (during
# playback). How does this affect your state machine? Which states
# need to check for unexpected button presses?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Sound design
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Are the four tones clearly distinguishable on your hardware? Try
# adjusting TONES to find four pitches that sound natural together.
# The traditional Simon tones are E4, C#5, A3, and E3, but these have
# been moved up an octave to E5, C#5, A4, and E4 (659 Hz, 554 Hz,
# 440 Hz, 330 Hz) so they sound better when played on the circuit's
# small piezo speaker.
