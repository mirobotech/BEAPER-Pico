# Capstone Project: Wall-Following Maze Solver [Wall_Follower.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (Robot configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# A maze-solving robot using the wall-following algorithm: keep one
# side of the robot a fixed distance from a wall, and you will
# eventually traverse every corridor connected to your starting point
# - this is a well-known property of simply-connected mazes (mazes
# with no isolated loops), not something this program has to detect
# or plan for specially. The same simple rule, applied repeatedly,
# handles corners, dead ends, and long straight corridors alike.
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2          - Start following
#   SW5          - Emergency stop (halts from any state)
#   LS1          - Piezo speaker (start beep, turn beep)
#   On-board LED - On while following
#
#   SONAR on H2/H3     - Ultrasonic distance sensor (front and side walls)
#   Servo on H5        - Sweeps the SONAR between a side-looking and a
#                        forward-looking angle
#
#   Motor 1 (M1A/M1B) - Left drive motor
#   Motor 2 (M2A/M2B) - Right drive motor
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sensing approach:
#
# A single SONAR sensor cannot look in two directions simultaneously,
# so this program mounts it on a servo and sweeps between two fixed
# angles - SIDE_ANGLE (facing the wall being followed) and
# FRONT_ANGLE (facing straight ahead) - reading the distance at each
# position before moving to the next. This is a non-blocking sweep:
# driving continues throughout, and steering decisions use the most
# recently completed pair of readings rather than pausing to wait for
# a fresh one every single loop iteration.
#
# Mount the servo so that SIDE_ANGLE points the SONAR toward
# FOLLOW_RIGHT_WALL's side (right if True, left if False), and
# FRONT_ANGLE points it straight ahead. The exact angle values will
# depend on your specific mechanical mounting - see Development
# Guide Step 1.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Wall-following behaviour (three cases, checked every sweep cycle):
#
#   Wall ahead (front distance < FRONT_WALL_THRESHOLD):
#     Cannot continue straight. Turn AWAY from the followed wall -
#     this eventually brings the followed wall back into range as
#     the corner is completed. A dead end simply means several of
#     these turns happen in a row until the robot is facing back out.
#
#   Gap in the followed wall (side distance > SIDE_GAP_THRESHOLD):
#     The wall has ended - an opening, a side corridor, or an outer
#     corner. Turn INTO the gap to keep following the wall around it.
#
#   Otherwise:
#     The wall is where it should be. Drive forward, with small
#     steering corrections to keep the side distance close to
#     TARGET_SIDE_DISTANCE.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Wall-follower behaviour:
#   IDLE      - Robot stationary. Press SW2 to begin.
#   FOLLOWING - Sweeping SONAR, driving, and steering as described above.
#   TURNING   - Executing a turn (away from a wall ahead, or into a
#               gap) for TURN_TIME ms, then returning to FOLLOWING.
#   STOPPED   - Motors halted. Press SW2 to return to IDLE.
#
# Before you begin - complete your capstone plan using the Capstone
# Preparation Guide: project description, state diagram, state
# details table, constants and variables, and testing plan. Test the
# servo sweep and SONAR readings independently before combining them
# into the following behaviour.

# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order. Test on the floor with the robot
# clear of obstacles when testing motor and servo directions for the
# first time.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Servo mounting and angle calibration
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Mount the SONAR on the servo horn so it can sweep between facing
# the side you intend to follow and facing straight ahead. Temporarily
# add these lines after beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, SIDE_ANGLE)
# near the top of the program:
#
# Example code:
#
# time.sleep_ms(2000)
# beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, FRONT_ANGLE)
# time.sleep_ms(2000)
# beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, SIDE_ANGLE)
#
# Adjust SIDE_ANGLE and FRONT_ANGLE until the SONAR genuinely points
# to the side you want to follow (matching FOLLOW_RIGHT_WALL) and
# then straight ahead. Remove the test lines once satisfied.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - SONAR readings at both angles
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Verify read_sonar() returns sensible distances at each angle. Place
# a wall or box at a known distance to the side, move the servo to
# SIDE_ANGLE, wait, and print the reading - repeat for FRONT_ANGLE
# with an object ahead. Set FRONT_WALL_THRESHOLD, SIDE_GAP_THRESHOLD,
# and TARGET_SIDE_DISTANCE from real measurements of your maze
# corridors, not guesses.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Motor direction verification
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Verify motor directions before driving in a maze:
#
# Example code:
#
# beaper.left_motor_forward()
# time.sleep_ms(500)
# beaper.motors_stop()
#
# If a motor runs backward, swap its wiring rather than changing the
# code. Confirm both motors together drive the robot straight forward.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - The sweep cycle
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the two TODO blocks in STATE_FOLLOWING's sweep logic,
# without the steering decision yet - just get the servo alternating
# between SIDE_ANGLE and FRONT_ANGLE, printing side_distance and
# front_distance each time a full cycle completes. Confirm both
# readings update correctly as you move objects around the robot.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Driving straight with steering correction
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the "otherwise" branch: drive forward, adjusting slightly
# based on side_distance versus TARGET_SIDE_DISTANCE. Test by placing
# the robot parallel to a wall, slightly too close and then slightly
# too far, and confirming it steers back toward the target distance
# each time.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6 - Turning
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement STATE_TURNING. Test both turn types separately: place a
# wall directly ahead of the robot (triggers TURN_AWAY) and separately
# create a gap in the followed wall (triggers TURN_INTO). Confirm the
# robot turns the correct physical direction for each - review the
# table in start_turn() if a turn direction seems backward.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 7 - Full maze run
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Build or find a simple maze (cardboard walls work well) and test a
# complete run. Watch the Serial Monitor for state transitions. Try a
# maze with at least one dead end and confirm the robot escapes it
# through repeated TURN_AWAY turns, without any special dead-end
# handling - this is the wall-following algorithm's key property.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Goal detection
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Detect when the robot has reached the maze exit and stop instead of
# continuing to follow walls forever. Options include a light sensor
# detecting a bright exit, a floor sensor detecting a marked finish
# line (reusing Line Follower's Q2/Q3 technique), or simply a fixed
# number of turns or a timeout if your maze layout is known in
# advance. Which approach fits the mazes you plan to test with?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Full-range sweep
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Instead of two fixed angles, sweep the servo through a wider range
# (for example five angles from -45 to +90 degrees relative to the
# robot) and take a reading at each. This gives a much richer picture
# of the maze around the robot and can detect an upcoming turn before
# the robot is close enough for the current two-angle version to
# react. How would you change the steering decision to use five
# readings instead of two?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Adaptive turn duration
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# TURN_TIME is currently fixed, which can under- or over-turn
# depending on corridor width. After a TURN_AWAY or TURN_INTO turn,
# have the robot check the side distance again before returning to
# FOLLOWING, and continue turning in small increments until the side
# distance is close to TARGET_SIDE_DISTANCE, rather than turning for
# a fixed time regardless of the result.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Path recording
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Record each turn (direction and approximate time or distance
# travelled since the last turn) to build a simple map of the path
# taken. Print the recorded path once the goal is reached (see EA1).
# This is a basic version of the "left-hand rule" maze-mapping
# technique used in real micromouse competitions.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Switch which wall is followed
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The servo sweep only covers one side, chosen by how you physically
# mounted the SONAR. What would a robot need, in hardware, to switch
# between following the left wall and the right wall without manually
# re-mounting anything? Consider a second SONAR facing the opposite
# side, or widening the servo's sweep range to cover both sides in
# one cycle (see EA2) and choosing which side's readings to act on
# based on FOLLOW_RIGHT_WALL.
