# ================================================================================
# Capstone Project: Combination Safe [Combination_Safe.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# A four-digit digital safe. SW2, SW3, SW4, and SW5 are the code
# buttons - any of the four can appear at any position in the code,
# and digits may repeat. Enter the correct four-button sequence to
# unlock; a wrong sequence resets silently with no visible feedback,
# so a would-be intruder learns nothing about which digit was wrong.
# The number of wrong attempts since the last successful unlock is
# logged silently and shown briefly the next time the safe opens.
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2-SW5    - Code entry buttons (all four used as code digits)
#   LED2       - Code-setting mode indicator (on while setting a new code)
#   LED5       - Attempt counter indicator (flashes after unlock if
#                any wrong attempts were logged)
#   LS1        - Piezo speaker (key feedback, code-set, unlock, wrong-code tones)
#   Servo on H5 (SERVO1 by default) - Locking mechanism
#
# NOTE ON HEADER PINS: unlike BEAPER Nano, BEAPER Pico's H5-H7 servo
# headers use dedicated GPIO pins, not shared with H1-H4 - so there
# is no pin conflict to worry about between your servo choice and
# your door-sensor header choice here. BEAPER Pico only has three
# servo channels (SERVO1/H5, SERVO2/H6, SERVO3/H7) rather than four -
# H8 is wired to the piezo speaker (LS1) instead of a fourth servo.
#
# Door sensor options (choose one):
#   Option A - Optical proximity sensor (contactless):
#     Two sub-choices, depending on which jumper position you use -
#     these share jumpers with other sensors, so only one is
#     available at a time:
#       - Q4 (ambient light sensor, JP set to Enviro.): detects the
#         door by the change in ambient room light as it swings shut.
#         Simple to mount, but the threshold depends on your room's
#         lighting and may need recalibrating if that changes.
#       - Q1, Q2, or Q3 (break-away floor/line sensors, matching
#         jumper set to Robot): detects the door by reflectivity as
#         a surface on the door approaches the sensor, the same way
#         these sensors detect a floor or line on the robot
#         platforms. More consistent regardless of room lighting,
#         but needs the sensor mounted close enough to the door to
#         pick up a clear reflectivity change as it closes.
#     Either way, set SENSOR_MODE = "optical" and calibrate
#     SENSOR_THRESHOLD for your setup - see take_sensor_baseline()
#     and Step 3 in the Development Guide below. Change
#     'beaper.light_level()' to 'beaper.Q1_level()' (or Q2/Q3) in
#     both functions if you use a floor/line sensor instead of Q4.
#
#   Option B - Contact switch on an expansion header:
#     A magnetic contact switch (reed switch) or a simple mechanical
#     switch (lever, roller, or pushbutton-style) both work here -
#     wire it to a spare header (H1-H4) and GND. Set
#     SENSOR_MODE = "contact" and SENSOR_CLOSED_VALUE to match your
#     switch type (0 for NC, 1 for NO).
#
#     Mechanical switches are more likely to be available in a
#     school's parts bins than magnetic reed switches, but their
#     contacts can bounce - producing several rapid open/close
#     readings over a few milliseconds as the contact settles, rather
#     than one clean transition. Reed switches usually bounce less,
#     but are not guaranteed to be bounce-free either. If
#     'door_is_closed()' behaves inconsistently right at the moment
#     the door closes, this is the likely cause - Activity 11 EA1's
#     debounce pattern is the tool for this, applied to
#     'door_switch.value()' instead of a pushbutton.
#
# Safe behaviour:
#   UNLOCKED  - Servo open. Hold SW2 for HOLD_TIME to enter
#               code-setting mode. If a code has been set, the door
#               sensor closing locks the safe automatically.
#
#   SETTING   - LED2 on. Any four button presses set the new code -
#               correctness does not apply while setting a code, only
#               while verifying one. Each press beeps for
#               confirmation. After the fourth press the new code is
#               saved and the safe returns to UNLOCKED, still open.
#
#   ENTRY_1-4 - Door is locked. Each press beeps neutrally with no
#               indication of correctness. After the fourth press:
#               correct code -> unlock tone, servo opens, any logged
#               attempts flash on LED5, attempt count resets to 0.
#               wrong code   -> silence, attempt count increments,
#               entry silently restarts at ENTRY_1.

# ================================================================================
# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order. Fully test each step before
# moving to the next - a capstone this size is much easier to debug
# in small pieces than all at once at the end.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Servo setup and angles
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Before any state logic, verify your servo moves correctly. The
# program already moves the servo to UNLOCKED_ANGLE at startup, using
# the board module's 'set_servo(servo, angle)' function from
# Activity 10. Temporarily add these lines right after that, and run
# the program:
#
# Example code:
#
# time.sleep_ms(2000)
# beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, LOCKED_ANGLE)
# time.sleep_ms(2000)
# beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, UNLOCKED_ANGLE)
#
# Adjust LOCKED_ANGLE and UNLOCKED_ANGLE until the servo moves your
# locking bar or bolt to the correct positions. Remove the test lines
# above once you are satisfied, and use 'beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1,
# angle)' everywhere the TODOs mention moving the servo.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Button reading
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Verify that 'read_button()' returns the correct number (2-5) for
# each of SW2-SW5, and 0 when nothing is pressed. Add a temporary
# print statement after the STATE_ENTRY_1 block's 'pressed =
# read_button()' line to confirm this before relying on it elsewhere.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Door sensor calibration
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Choose your sensor mode and implement 'door_is_closed()'. For
# optical mode, print 'beaper.light_level()' (or Q1/Q2/Q3, whichever
# you chose) while opening and closing the door to find a
# SENSOR_THRESHOLD that reliably distinguishes the two. For contact
# mode, test that 'door_switch.value()' returns the expected reading
# for both open and closed. Verify 'door_is_closed()' returns True
# only when the door is actually closed, in both directions of
# travel.
#
# If you are using a mechanical contact switch, watch closely for
# bounce right at the moment the door closes - print
# 'door_switch.value()' on every loop iteration for a second or two
# around the transition and look for rapid flickering rather than one
# clean change. See the header comment's note on Option B for what
# to do if you find it.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Code setting
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the code-commit TODO in STATE_SETTING. Test:
# - LED2 lights when SW2 is held for HOLD_TIME, and turns off after
#   the fourth press
# - Each of the four presses produces a short beep
# - A different code can be set by repeating the hold process
# - The safe remains physically unlocked throughout code-setting
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Entry states and locking
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Complete STATE_ENTRY_2 and STATE_ENTRY_3 by following
# STATE_ENTRY_1's pattern. With a code set, close the door (or
# simulate the sensor) and verify the servo moves to LOCKED_ANGLE and
# the state transitions to ENTRY_1. Print the sensor reading and the
# result of 'door_is_closed()' during this test if the threshold
# needs adjusting.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6 - Code entry and unlock
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the correct and wrong-code branches in STATE_ENTRY_4.
# Test the complete lock/unlock cycle:
# - Set a code from UNLOCKED
# - Close the door (auto-locks)
# - Enter the correct code - servo should open
# - Enter a wrong code - silence, no visible feedback, entry restarts
# - Enter the correct code again after one or more wrong attempts -
#   verify flash_attempts() fires and attempt_count resets to 0
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 7 - Attempt display
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement 'flash_attempts()'. The flash should be noticeable but
# not alarming - a few slow flashes of LED5, for example. Verify the
# count is accurate and LED5 clears after the display finishes.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Auto-relock after timeout
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# After unlocking, if the door sensor shows the door has been open
# for RELOCK_TIMEOUT milliseconds, sound a warning beep and re-lock
# automatically. This prevents leaving the safe open accidentally.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Lockout after repeated failures
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# After LOCKOUT_ATTEMPTS wrong codes in a row, freeze the keypad for
# LOCKOUT_TIME milliseconds. Flash LED5 continuously during lockout.
# No button presses accepted. This slows brute-force attempts
# significantly. Add a STATE_LOCKOUT and update your state diagram.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Progress indicator during entry
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# LED3 and LED4 are not used anywhere in the base program. Light one
# additional LED per digit entered during ENTRY_1-4, the same
# cumulative bar-graph pattern used in Activity 12's combination
# lock, so someone entering the code can see their progress without
# counting beeps. Should this progress indicator also appear during
# STATE_SETTING? Consider whether showing progress while setting a
# new code makes the safe easier to use, or easier to observe by
# someone who should not see the new code being set.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Code change confirmation
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Require the existing code to be entered correctly before a new one
# can be set. Add a STATE_VERIFY between the SW2 hold and
# STATE_SETTING - only proceed to SETTING if the current code is
# entered correctly first. This prevents someone from changing the
# code without knowing the original, even while the safe is unlocked.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Variable code length
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Extend the code to five or six digits, following the same pattern
# used to go from Activity 12's three-digit lock to this capstone's
# four digits: one more STATE_ENTRY_n, one more entered_n variable,
# and one more code_n variable per additional digit. At what code
# length does adding states and variables one at a time start to
# feel unwieldy? This is the same tradeoff Activity 12 EA3 raised -
# a fully flexible length would use a list and a loop with an index
# variable, which you will meet in the intermediate activities.
