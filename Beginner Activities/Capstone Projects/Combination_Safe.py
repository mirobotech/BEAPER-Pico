Capstone Project: Combination Safe [BEAPER_Pico-Capstone_Combination_Safe.py]
May 11, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Hardware used:
    SW2-SW5    - Code entry buttons (all four used as code digits)
    LED2       - Code-setting mode indicator (on while setting code)
    LED5       - Attempt counter indicator (flashes on unlock if attempts > 0)
    LS1        - Piezo speaker (key feedback, code set, unlock, wrong code tones)
    Servo on H9 or H10 - Locking mechanism (LOCKED_ANGLE / UNLOCKED_ANGLE)

Door sensor options (choose one):
    Option A - Optical proximity sensor (contactless):
        Set JP1 to Enviro. to use Q4 (ambient light sensor). Mount so the
        sensor detects the door closing (light level changes). Set
        SENSOR_MODE = "optical". Calibrate SENSOR_THRESHOLD for your setup.

    Option B - Hard-wired contact switch on expansion header:
        Wire a normally-closed (NC) or normally-open (NO) magnetic contact
        to H1 (or H2, H3, H4) and GND. Set SENSOR_MODE = "contact" and
        SENSOR_CLOSED_VALUE to match your switch type (0 for NC, 1 for NO).

Compatible with all BEAPER Nano configurations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Safe behaviour:
    UNLOCKED  - Servo open. Any number of failed unlock attempts are logged
                            silently. Hold SW2 for 2 seconds to enter code-setting mode.
                            Door closing (sensor) automatically locks if a code is set.

    SETTING   - LED2 on. Enter any four button presses to set the new code.
                            Each press beeps for confirmation. After four presses the code
                            is saved, LED2 turns off, and the safe returns to UNLOCKED.
                            The safe remains physically unlocked throughout.

    LOCKED    - Each button press beeps neutrally. After four presses:
                            correct code -> unlock tone, servo opens, attempt flash if any.
                            wrong code   -> silence, counter increments, entry resets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin - complete your capstone plan:
    1. Write a plain-English description from the user's perspective.
    2. List all states and draw your state diagram with transitions.
    3. Complete the state details table (outputs, transitions, next states).
    4. List all constants and variables you will need.
    5. Write your testing plan before writing any code.

Capstone Development Guide

Work through these steps in order. Fully test each step before
proceeding to the next.

Step 1 - Servo setup and angles
  Before any state logic, verify your servo moves correctly.
  Temporarily add these lines after servo_angle(UNLOCKED_ANGLE)
  in the main program and run the program:

    time.sleep_ms(2000)
    servo_angle(LOCKED_ANGLE)
    time.sleep_ms(2000)
    servo_angle(UNLOCKED_ANGLE)

  Adjust LOCKED_ANGLE and UNLOCKED_ANGLE until the servo moves
  your locking bar or bolt to the correct positions. Remove the
  test lines when satisfied. Note: servo wiring requires the servo
  signal wire on the correct pin of H9 or H10.

Step 2 - Button edge detection
  Verify that read_any_press() returns the correct index (0-3) exactly
  once per physical press, not repeatedly while held. Add a temporary
  print statement inside the function to confirm each button maps to
  the expected index before implementing any state logic.

Step 3 - Door sensor calibration
  Choose your sensor mode and implement door_is_closed(). For optical
  mode, print light_level() while opening and closing the door to find
  the threshold. For contact mode, test that the correct pin value is
  returned for open and closed states. Verify door_is_closed() returns
  True only when the door is physically closed.

Step 4 - Code setting
  Implement the code commit logic in STATE_SETTING. Test:
  - LED2 lights on SW2 hold and extinguishes after four presses
  - Each of the four presses produces a short beep
  - A different code can be set by repeating the hold process
  - The safe remains physically unlocked throughout

Step 5 - Locking
  With a code set, close the door (or simulate the sensor) and verify
  the servo moves to LOCKED_ANGLE and the state transitions to LOCKED.
  Print the sensor reading and the result of door_is_closed() during
  this test to confirm the threshold is working correctly.

Step 6 - Code entry and unlock
  Implement the correct and wrong code branches in STATE_LOCKED.
  Test the complete lock/unlock cycle:
  - Set a code from UNLOCKED
  - Close the door (auto-locks)
  - Enter the correct code - servo should open
  - Enter a wrong code - silence, no visible feedback
  - Enter the correct code again after wrong attempts - verify
    flash_attempts() fires and attempt_count resets

Step 7 - Attempt display
  Implement flash_attempts(). The flash should be noticeable but not
  alarming - 3 slow flashes of LED5, for example. Verify the count
  is accurate and clears after display.

Step 8 - Extensions

  a) Auto-relock after timeout: after unlocking, if the door sensor
     shows the door has been open for RELOCK_TIMEOUT milliseconds,
     sound a warning beep and re-lock automatically. This prevents
     leaving the safe open accidentally.

  b) Lockout after repeated failures: after LOCKOUT_ATTEMPTS wrong
     codes in a row, freeze the keypad for LOCKOUT_TIME milliseconds.
     Flash LED5 continuously during lockout. No button presses accepted.
     This slows brute-force attempts significantly.

  c) Variable code length (up to 8 digits): replace CODE_LENGTH with
     a variable current_length. In code-setting mode, accept presses
     until SW2 is held briefly to commit, rather than waiting for a
     fixed count. Adjust entry[] and code[] arrays to size 8.
     How does this change the state logic in STATE_SETTING?

  d) Code change confirmation: require the existing code to be entered
     before the new code can be set. Add a STATE_VERIFY step between
     the SW2 hold and STATE_SETTING. Only enter SETTING if the current
     code is entered correctly first, preventing someone from changing
     the code without knowing the original.
