# Capstone Project: Reaction Time Game [Reaction_Game.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# Two reaction-testing games in one, selected with SW3/SW4:
#
#   SIMPLE   - React as fast as possible to an unpredictable stimulus.
#              LED2 lights up after a random delay - press SW2 the
#              instant it does. Pressing too early ends the trial
#              immediately as a false start, the same way real
#              reaction-time testing works.
#
#   TIMING   - React at the RIGHT MOMENT to a predictable, repeating
#              pattern instead. LED2-LED5 chase continuously in a
#              loop; press SW2 exactly when the chase reaches the
#              target LED (LED4). Unlike SIMPLE, the pattern's timing
#              is known in advance - this tests anticipation and
#              rhythm judgement rather than raw speed.
#
# Both modes measure the same underlying thing - how close your
# press was to a reference moment in time - but the character of
# that reference moment (unpredictable vs. predictable) is what
# makes them test genuinely different skills.
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2          - Start a round / react during a round
#   SW3 / SW4    - Cycle game mode (only while at the menu)
#   SW5          - Cancel the current round, return to the menu
#   LS1          - Piezo speaker (stimulus/target beep, result tones)
#   On-board LED - On during an active round
#
# Compatible with all BEAPER Pico configurations. No additional
# hardware or jumper changes required.

# ================================================================================
# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order. Test SIMPLE mode completely
# before starting TIMING mode - they share very little code, but the
# overall program structure (state transitions, result display) is
# easiest to get right once with one working mode as a reference.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Menu and mode selection
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The menu and mode-cycling logic (SW3/SW4 in STATE_MENU) is already
# complete. Run the program and confirm pressing SW3 or SW4 toggles
# between SIMPLE and TIMING, printing the mode name each time.
# Confirm SW2 calls start_round() and transitions to the correct
# first state for whichever mode is selected (STATE_WAITING for
# SIMPLE, STATE_CHASING for TIMING).
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - False start detection
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the false-start TODO in STATE_WAITING. Test by starting a
# SIMPLE round and immediately pressing SW2 before the LED lights.
# Confirm this transitions straight to STATE_RESULT without ever
# lighting REACT_LED.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Stimulus and reaction timing
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the remaining TODO in STATE_WAITING (lighting the
# stimulus) and the TODO in STATE_REACT (measuring the press).
# Test several rounds and confirm reaction_time values look
# reasonable (human simple reaction time is typically 150-300ms) and
# that best_reaction_time only updates when a round is genuinely
# faster than the previous best.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Chase animation
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the chase animation portion of the TODO in STATE_CHASING,
# without the press-handling yet. Confirm the four LEDs light in
# sequence, looping continuously, at the rate set by
# CHASE_INTERVAL_MS, and that a beep sounds each time the chase
# passes over the target LED (LED4).
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Timing measurement and its limitation
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the press-handling portion of the TODO in STATE_CHASING.
# Test by pressing SW2 at different points in the chase cycle and
# confirming timing_error is small when you press near the target
# LED and large otherwise.
#
# This measurement has a known limitation worth understanding: it is
# calculated only against the MOST RECENT time the target lit, not
# whichever occurrence (past or upcoming) is actually closer. Press
# SW2 just before the chase is about to reach the target again - you
# should genuinely be very close in time, but timing_error will
# report a value close to a full chase cycle instead of close to
# zero, because it is measuring backward to the previous lit moment
# rather than forward to the upcoming one. Confirm you can observe
# this for yourself before moving on - EA 'improved timing
# measurement' below addresses it properly.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6 - Result display
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement STATE_RESULT. Test that each of the three result types
# (SIMPLE false start, SIMPLE normal, TIMING) prints a clear,
# distinguishable message, and that the program correctly returns to
# STATE_MENU after RESULT_DISPLAY_MS with the previously selected
# mode still active.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Improved timing measurement
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Fix the limitation identified in Development Guide Step 5: rather
# than measuring only backward to the most recent time the target
# lit, compute the shortest distance to either the most recent OR
# the next upcoming occurrence, whichever is closer. This is the
# same "shortest distance around a repeating cycle" problem Stepper
# Controller's EA1 (bidirectional movement) solves for a rotating
# position - the chase's position within its 4-step cycle is directly
# analogous to the stepper's position within a full revolution.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Running average
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Beyond tracking only the single best result, keep a running sum
# and count of every trial's result (in either mode) and display the
# average alongside the best. How does the average compare to the
# best across many trials - does it reveal anything the best score
# alone does not?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Choice reaction time
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a third mode where, instead of always lighting REACT_LED, the
# stimulus randomly lights ONE of LED2-LED5 (reusing the read_button()
# style pattern from Simon Game or Combination Safe), and the player
# must press the MATCHING button (SW2-SW5) as quickly as possible.
# This tests both reaction speed and discrimination together - a
# real, named distinction in human factors research called "choice
# reaction time," typically measurably slower than simple reaction
# time even though it uses the same LEDs and buttons.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Rhythm matching
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a fourth mode with a steady metronome beep and flash at a
# fixed tempo (reuse Activity 11's repeating-timer pattern
# directly). The player tries to press SW2 in sync with each beat,
# and each press is scored by how close it lands to the nearest
# beat - similar in spirit to TIMING mode, but matching a continuous
# rhythm rather than a single target point in a longer cycle. Track
# and display a running average timing error across several beats
# rather than just one round's result.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Head-to-head
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a two-player mode: both players' buttons (for example SW2 and
# SW5, freeing SW5 from its cancel role while this mode is active)
# watch the same SIMPLE-style unpredictable stimulus, and whichever
# player presses first wins the round. This reuses SIMPLE mode's
# false-start and stimulus-timing logic almost entirely - the main
# difference is in STATE_REACT, which now needs to check two buttons
# and determine which was pressed first, rather than measuring one
# button's absolute reaction time.
