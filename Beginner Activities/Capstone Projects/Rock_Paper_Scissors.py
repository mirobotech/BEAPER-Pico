# Capstone Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors [RockPaperScissors.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# A single-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer.
# Press SW5 to begin a round: a 3-2-1 countdown flashes and beeps,
# speeding up as it counts down, then a short window opens for you
# to make your choice. Miss the window and it counts as too slow -
# no result is compared.
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2 - Rock
#   SW3 - Paper
#   SW4 - Scissors
#   SW5 - Start a round
#   LS1 - Piezo speaker (countdown beeps, "go" tone, outcome tones)
#
# Compatible with all BEAPER Pico configurations. No additional
# hardware or jumper changes required.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Game behaviour:
#   IDLE      - Waiting. Press SW5 to begin.
#   COUNTDOWN - 3-2-1, LED2-LED4 flash together with a beep on each
#               count. The gap between counts shrinks as it
#               progresses - see COUNTDOWN_INTERVALS below.
#   CHOOSING  - A short window opens (CHOOSE_WINDOW_MS). Press SW2,
#               SW3, or SW4 for your choice. No press before the
#               window closes counts as too slow.
#   REVEAL    - The computer's choice is generated, compared against
#               yours, and the result (win/lose/tie/too slow) is
#               announced with a distinct tone pattern and printed to
#               the Serial Monitor. Session totals (wins/losses/ties)
#               are tracked throughout.
#

# ================================================================================
# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Understand the countdown
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# STATE_COUNTDOWN is already complete and working - read through it
# before starting on the TODOs elsewhere. It uses two nested timers:
# an outer one (count_elapsed vs COUNTDOWN_INTERVALS[countdown_index])
# tracking how long the CURRENT count has been running in total, and
# an inner one (the same count_elapsed vs FLASH_TIME) tracking only
# how long the LEDs should stay lit within that count. This is the
# same non-blocking repeating-timer pattern from Activity 11, applied
# twice at once - once for the overall count duration, once for the
# shorter flash within it.
#
# Run the program and press SW5. Confirm the countdown flashes three
# times, getting visibly faster and higher-pitched each time, then
# plays a distinct "go" tone and transitions to CHOOSING (check the
# Serial Monitor for the state transition, since nothing is
# implemented in CHOOSING yet).
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Reading the player's choice
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the button-reading TODO in STATE_CHOOSING. Test that
# pressing SW2, SW3, or SW4 during the choosing window correctly
# records player_choice and transitions to STATE_REVEAL - check the
# Serial Monitor's state transition message for each.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Timeout handling
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the timeout TODO in STATE_CHOOSING. Test by starting a
# round and simply waiting without pressing anything - confirm it
# transitions to STATE_REVEAL after CHOOSE_WINDOW_MS with
# player_choice still CHOICE_NONE.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Determining the winner
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the TODO in STATE_REVEAL. Test all nine possible
# combinations of player choice vs. computer choice deliberately -
# this is easiest by temporarily hardcoding computer_choice to a
# fixed value instead of using random.randint() while you test each
# of your three choices against it, then restoring the random version
# once you have confirmed the win/lose/tie logic is correct for every
# combination.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Outcome feedback and return to idle
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add the tone patterns and LED feedback described in the TODO, and
# implement the return-to-idle timing. Confirm a full round - start,
# countdown, choose, reveal, and return to idle - works correctly
# several times in a row, and that win_count/loss_count/tie_count
# accumulate correctly across multiple rounds without resetting.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Best-of-N match
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Layer a "match" concept on top of individual rounds: track a match
# score separately from the session totals, and end the match (with
# a distinct fanfare) once either the player or the computer reaches
# a set number of wins (best of 5, for example). What should happen
# to the match score when SW5 starts a new round after a match has
# already ended?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Elegant win-determination refactor
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The if/elif chain in STATE_REVEAL checks three specific winning
# combinations explicitly. There is a more compact way to determine
# the same result using modular arithmetic: with choices numbered
# 0, 1, 2 (Rock, Paper, Scissors), the player wins whenever
# (player_choice - computer_choice) % 3 == 1, and loses whenever it
# equals 2 (0 means a tie). Verify this produces identical results
# to your existing if/elif chain for all nine combinations before
# replacing it - why does this formula work? (Hint: consider what
# each choice "beats" as you move one step forward through the cycle
# Rock -> Paper -> Scissors -> Rock.)
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Adaptive computer opponent
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Instead of choosing randomly every time, track how many times the
# player has chosen each of Rock/Paper/Scissors across the session
# (three counters, similar to win_count/loss_count/tie_count) and
# bias the computer's choice toward whichever counters the player's
# most frequent pick. This is a simple introduction to
# pattern-based prediction rather than pure randomness - does it
# actually make the computer harder to beat once you have played
# enough rounds for a pattern to emerge? How would a player adapt
# their own strategy once they suspect the computer is doing this?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Escalating time pressure
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Reuse Simon Game's "difficulty increases with progress" idea:
# shrink CHOOSE_WINDOW_MS by a fixed amount after each round within
# a session (with a reasonable minimum so it never becomes
# impossible), so the game gets tenser to play the longer a session
# continues. Should the window reset to its original length after a
# "too slow" round, or keep shrinking regardless of outcome?
