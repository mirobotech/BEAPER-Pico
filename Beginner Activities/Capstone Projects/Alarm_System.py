# ================================================================================
# Capstone Project: Alarm System [Alarm_System.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# A five-state intrusion alarm. Arm and disarm with the same
# four-button code, entered the same way as the Activity 12 capstone
# combination lock and safe: any button may be pressed at each step,
# and correctness is only checked once all four digits are in, so a
# wrong attempt reveals nothing about which digit was incorrect.
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2-SW5    - Arm/disarm code entry buttons (all four used as code digits)
#   LED2-LED5  - Alarm system state indicators
#   LS1        - Piezo speaker (entry beeps, countdown, alarm tone)
#
# Sensor options (choose one, or combine - see EA3):
#   Option A - Optical proximity sensor (contactless):
#     Two sub-choices, depending on which jumper position you use -
#     these share jumpers with other sensors, so only one is
#     available at a time:
#       - Q4 (ambient light sensor, JP set to Enviro.): an object or
#         hand passing in front of the sensor changes the light
#         reading. Mount the circuit inside the protected space so
#         the sensor faces the opening.
#       - Q1, Q2, or Q3 (break-away floor/line sensors, matching
#         jumper set to Robot): detects a trip by reflectivity, the
#         same way these sensors detect a floor or line on the robot
#         platforms. More consistent regardless of room lighting.
#     Either way, set SENSOR_MODE = "optical" and calibrate
#     SENSOR_THRESHOLD for your setup - see take_sensor_baseline()
#     and Step 1 in the Development Guide below. Change
#     'beaper.light_level()' to 'beaper.Q1_level()' (or Q2/Q3) in
#     both functions if you use a floor/line sensor instead of Q4.
#
#   Option B - Contact switch on an expansion header:
#     A magnetic contact switch (reed switch) or a simple mechanical
#     switch (lever, roller, or pushbutton-style) both work here -
#     wire a normally-closed (NC) switch to a spare header and GND.
#     Set SENSOR_MODE = "contact". A mechanical switch is more likely
#     to be available in a school's parts bin than a reed switch, but
#     its contacts can bounce - see Activity 11 EA1's debounce
#     pattern if 'check_sensors()' behaves inconsistently right at
#     the moment of a trip.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Alarm system behaviour:
#   DISARMED  - Safe. Enter the arm code to begin arming. If alarms
#               occurred since the last disarm, the count is displayed.
#   ARMING    - Exit delay: sensors ignored while you leave. LEDs
#               count down. Do NOT enter the code during this phase.
#   ARMED     - Sensors active. Circuit goes dark. Do not touch buttons.
#   TRIPPED   - Entry delay: sensor tripped, enter the disarm code now
#               or the alarm will sound. LEDs flash urgently.
#   ALARM     - Alarm sounding. Enter the code to disarm. The alarm
#               records itself. Stops after ALARM_DURATION, then re-arms.
#

# Preparation Guide: project description, state diagram, state
# details table, constants and variables, and testing plan.

# ================================================================================
# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order. Test each step thoroughly
# before continuing - a working partial system is always better
# than a broken complete one.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Sensor configuration and baseline
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Choose your sensor mode and implement 'check_sensors()'.
#
# For optical mode: mount the sensor facing the door or opening. Run
# the program, open the door slowly, and print the sensor reading
# every loop iteration to find the typical range of values when
# undisturbed vs. disturbed. Set SENSOR_THRESHOLD to a value
# comfortably between the two.
#
# For contact mode: wire your NC switch to H1 (or another header -
# update sensor_switch if so) and GND. Verify that 'check_sensors()'
# returns True when the door is open and False when closed. If using
# a mechanical switch, watch for bounce right at the moment of the
# transition - see the header comment's note on Option B.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Disarmed state and code entry
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the arm transition from STATE_DISARMED. Code entry
# itself is already handled by 'check_code_entry()' - you only need
# to act on the CODE_CORRECT result. Test carefully:
# - Correct sequence transitions to ARMING
# - Wrong sequence resets silently (stays in DISARMED, no feedback
#   beyond the neutral key beeps already heard during entry)
# - A partial sequence followed by the correct remaining digits works
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Arming (exit delay)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the countdown in STATE_ARMING. Test that sensors are
# genuinely ignored during the exit delay by triggering them while
# the countdown runs. Verify the circuit goes dark when ARMED.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Armed and tripped
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the entry delay in STATE_TRIPPED. Test the full
# arm -> trip -> disarm sequence:
# - Arm the system
# - Trigger the sensor
# - Enter the code within ENTRY_DELAY
# - Verify STATE_DISARMED is reached with no alarm recorded
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Alarm and re-arm
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement STATE_ALARM. Test the full arm -> trip -> timeout ->
# alarm -> re-arm sequence. Verify alarm_count increments correctly
# and is displayed on the next successful disarm.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6 - Alarm count display
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement 'display_alarm_count()' with a visible LED display, not
# just the console message already provided. Verify the count is
# accurate and clears after being shown.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Acknowledge and clear the alarm count
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# After the alarm count is displayed on entry to DISARMED, require a
# button press to acknowledge it before accepting a new arm code.
# What happens currently if the user starts entering a new code
# while the count is still displaying?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Tamper protection
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# If SENSOR_MODE is "contact" and the sensor trips while in
# STATE_ARMED, add a check that the sensor is still tripped a short
# time later before transitioning to STATE_TRIPPED - a very brief
# trip could indicate a tamper attempt rather than genuine entry.
# Log tamper attempts separately from alarm_count.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Multiple sensors
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Extend 'check_sensors()' to read both an optical sensor and a
# contact switch, returning True if either is triggered. Print which
# sensor tripped to the console for debugging.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Changeable code
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a mode (triggered by a special button sequence from DISARMED)
# that lets the user change the arm/disarm code. CORRECT_1-4 are
# currently declared with 'const()', which MicroPython treats as
# fixed at compile time - not reassignable while the program runs.
# The first step is removing 'const()' from each, the same way
# Combination Safe separates DEFAULT_CODE_1-4 (fixed starting point)
# from code_1-4 (the current, changeable code). Once they are plain
# variables, how will the new code persist if the board loses power?
# A fully persistent version would write the new code to a file,
# which is covered in the intermediate activities.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Panic button
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# SW5 held for 3 seconds in any state immediately transitions to
# STATE_ALARM and increments alarm_count, simulating a manual
# panic/duress feature found in real alarm systems. You will need
# the 'button_is_down' / 'button_down_time' hold-detection pattern
# from Activity 11, checked independently of 'check_code_entry()'
# since SW5 is also one of the four code digits. What changes does
# this require to avoid a held SW5 being misread as a code digit at
# the same time?
