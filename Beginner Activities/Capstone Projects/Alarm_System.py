Capstone Project: Alarm System [BEAPER_Pico-Capstone_Alarm_System.py]
May 11, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Hardware used:
    SW2-SW5    - Arm/disarm code entry buttons
    LED2-LED5  - Alarm system state indicators
    LS1        - Piezo speaker (entry countdown beeps, alarm tone)

Sensor options (choose one or combine):
    Option A - Optical proximity sensor (contactless, no wiring needed):
        Set JP1 to Enviro. to use Q4 (ambient light sensor) as a proximity
        sensor. An object or hand passing in front of the sensor changes
        the light reading. Mount the circuit inside the locker or room so
        the sensor faces the opening. Set SENSOR_MODE = "optical".

    Option B - Hard-wired contact switch on expansion header:
        Wire a normally-closed (NC) magnetic door/drawer contact switch
        between H1 (or H2, H3, H4) and GND. When the door opens the
        circuit breaks, pulling H1 HIGH. Set SENSOR_MODE = "contact" and
        set SENSOR_PIN to match your header choice.

    You can combine both: check_sensors() can read both and return True
    if either is triggered. See check_sensors() below.

Compatible with all BEAPER Nano configurations.
Optical sensor: set JP1 to Enviro. (selects ambient light sensor Q4).
Contact sensor: no jumper changes required, wire to H1-H4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alarm system behaviour:
    DISARMED  - Safe. Enter the arm code to begin arming.
                            If alarms occurred since last disarm, count is displayed.
    ARMING    - Exit delay: sensors ignored while you leave. LEDs count
                            down. Do NOT enter the code during this phase.
    ARMED     - Sensors active. Circuit goes dark. Do not touch buttons.
    TRIPPED   - Entry delay: sensors tripped, enter disarm code now or
                            alarm will sound. LEDs flash urgently.
    ALARM     - Alarm sounding. Enter code to disarm. Alarm records
                            itself. Stops after ALARM_DURATION, then re-arms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin - complete your capstone plan:
    1. Write a plain-English description from the user's perspective.
    2. List all states and draw your state diagram with transitions.
    3. Complete the state details table (outputs, transitions, next states).
    4. List all constants and variables you will need.
    5. Write your testing plan before writing any code.

Capstone Development Guide

Work through these steps in order. Test each step thoroughly before
continuing - a working partial system is always better than a broken
complete one.

Step 1 - Sensor configuration and baseline
  Choose your sensor mode ("optical" or "contact") and configure
  check_sensors() to return True when the sensor is triggered.

  For optical mode: set JP1 to Enviro. Mount the circuit with Q4
  facing the door or opening. Run the program, open the door slowly,
  and print the light level every loop iteration to find the typical
  range of values when undisturbed vs disturbed. Set SENSOR_THRESHOLD
  to a value comfortably between the two ranges.

  For contact mode: wire your NC switch between H1 and GND. Verify
  that check_sensors() returns True when the door is open and False
  when closed before implementing any state logic.

Step 2 - Disarmed state and code entry
  Implement the arm code transition from STATE_DISARMED. The code
  entry is handled by check_code_entry() - you only need to act on
  the CODE_CORRECT result. Test the code entry carefully:
  - Correct sequence transitions to ARMING
  - Wrong button resets silently (stays in DISARMED)
  - Partial sequence followed by correct completion works

Step 3 - Arming (exit delay)
  Implement the countdown in STATE_ARMING. Test that sensors are
  genuinely ignored during the exit delay by triggering them while
  the countdown runs. Verify the circuit goes dark when ARMED.

Step 4 - Armed and tripped
  Implement sensor checking in STATE_ARMED and the entry delay in
  STATE_TRIPPED. Test the full arm → trip → disarm sequence:
  - Arm the system
  - Trigger the sensor
  - Enter the code within ENTRY_DELAY
  - Verify STATE_DISARMED is reached with no alarm recorded

Step 5 - Alarm and re-arm
  Implement STATE_ALARM. Test the full arm → trip → timeout → alarm
  → re-arm sequence. Verify alarm_count increments correctly and
  is displayed on the next successful disarm.

Step 6 - Refinements and extensions

  a) Display improvements: implement display_alarm_count() to show
     the count visually (LED flashes) as well as via serial output.
     Add a button press in DISARMED to acknowledge and clear the
     count after it has been displayed.

  b) Tamper protection: if SENSOR_MODE is "contact" and the sensor
     trips while in STATE_ARMED, add a check that the sensor is still
     tripped when transitioning to STATE_TRIPPED (a very brief trip
     could indicate a tamper attempt rather than entry). Log it.

  c) Multiple sensors: extend check_sensors() to read both an optical
     sensor and a contact switch. Return True if either is triggered.
     Print which sensor tripped to the serial console for debugging.

  d) Code change: add a mode (triggered by a special button sequence
     from DISARMED) that allows the user to change the arm/disarm code.
     How will you store the new code so it persists between sessions?
     Consider using a list instead of a tuple for ARM_CODE if you want
     it to be mutable.

  e) Panic button: SW5 held for 3 seconds in any state immediately
     transitions to STATE_ALARM and increments alarm_count. This
     simulates a manual panic/duress feature found in real alarm systems.
     What changes to the state machine does this require?
