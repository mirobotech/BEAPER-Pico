# Capstone Project: Stepper Motor Controller [Stepper_Controller.py]
# Version: 1.1
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (Robot configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# A position-tracking stepper motor controller. Unlike a servo (which
# is commanded directly to an angle) or a DC motor (which only knows
# speed and direction), a stepper motor moves in small, precise,
# individually-countable steps - the motor itself has no idea where
# it is, but a program that counts every step it commands always
# knows the motor's exact position. This is the core idea this
# capstone explores.
#
# The example application rotates continuously, completing one full
# revolution every ROTATION_PERIOD_MS - like a clock hand, but not
# synced to real-world time (this curriculum has no real-time clock
# or network time source available). Set ROTATION_PERIOD_MS to 60000
# for something that behaves like a seconds hand, or to a much longer
# period for a slow display turntable - the same mechanism works for
# either application, or for one that visits a fixed set of preset
# positions instead of rotating continuously (see EA2).
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2          - Start rotating
#   SW5          - Emergency stop (halts stepping, holds tracked position)
#   On-board LED - On while running
#
#   A two-coil (bipolar) stepper motor, driven through the SN754410NE
#   half-bridge driver already on the BEAPER Pico circuit - the same
#   chip that normally drives the two DC drive motors. Coil A
#   connects where the left motor normally would (M1A/M1B), and coil
#   B where the right motor normally would (M2A/M2B).
#
# IMPORTANT: this uses all four of the driver's half-bridges for the
# stepper's two coils, the same way two DC motors normally would.
# This project is a different robot configuration from Line Follower,
# Sumo Robot, or Wall Follower - it cannot run alongside two
# independent drive motors, since there are no half-bridges left over
# once the stepper is connected. Unlike an external unipolar stepper
# driver (such as a ULN2003 board), this approach needs no extra
# wiring beyond what the circuit already provides for DC motors, and
# leaves H1-H4 completely free for sensors or other input/output
# devices - a genuine advantage if your application needs them.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How the step sequence works:
#
# A bipolar stepper has two coils, each needing current that can
# flow in EITHER direction - not just on or off. This is exactly what
# a full H-bridge motor driver already provides: left_motor_forward()
# and left_motor_reverse() drive coil A's current one way then the
# other, and right_motor_forward()/right_motor_reverse() do the same
# for coil B. A full rotation step advances through four
# combinations of these two coils' polarities:
#
#   Phase 0: coil A forward, coil B forward
#   Phase 1: coil A reverse, coil B forward
#   Phase 2: coil A reverse, coil B reverse
#   Phase 3: coil A forward, coil B reverse
#
# Each phase differs from the one before it by reversing exactly one
# coil's polarity - this is what produces smooth, single-step
# rotation rather than skipping steps. See Development Guide Step 1
# to verify this phase order (and which physical direction it
# produces) matches your specific motor's wiring.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stepper controller behaviour:
#   IDLE    - Motors stopped (no current, free to turn by hand).
#             Press SW2 to begin.
#   RUNNING - Continuously computing where the motor should be, based
#             on elapsed time, and stepping forward to catch up.
#   STOPPED - Stepping halted, motors stopped. Position tracking is
#             preserved, but note that a de-energised stepper can be
#             turned by hand or by an external force - if that
#             happens while stopped, the tracked position will no
#             longer match the real one. Press SW2 to resume; the
#             motor will step forward to catch up to where it should
#             be by now, exactly as a real clock hand would if it had
#             been temporarily held still while time kept passing.
#
# Before you begin - complete your capstone plan using the Capstone
# Preparation Guide: a plain-English description of your application
# (clock hand, turntable, or something else), how many steps your
# motor takes per revolution, your testing plan, and which of your
# stepper's four wires connect to which motor terminal.

# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order. Test the step sequence at a very
# slow, manually-triggered pace before running full-speed - a
# miswired sequence can make the motor buzz, vibrate, or turn the
# wrong direction without actually stepping usefully.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Step sequence verification
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Temporarily add this loop after beaper.motors_stop() near the top
# of the program, and remove it once the sequence is confirmed
# correct:
#
# Example code:
#
# for i in range(20):
#     step_forward()
#     print("step", i, "position", current_position)
#     time.sleep_ms(300)
#
# Watch the motor. It should rotate smoothly in one direction, one
# small step per call. If it vibrates or buzzes without turning, two
# of your stepper's four wires are likely swapped on one coil's
# terminals, or the two coils are swapped between M1A/M1B and
# M2A/M2B - try swapping the wire pairs and testing again. If it
# turns the wrong direction for your application, that is fine to
# leave as-is (step_forward() always steps whichever way the phase
# order above produces) - simply consider "forward" to mean whichever
# direction this produces.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Steps per revolution
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Mark the output shaft (a piece of tape works well) and count how
# many calls to step_forward() are needed for exactly one full
# revolution back to the mark. Set STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION to this
# measured value rather than trusting the 200 default, which varies
# between motors - check your specific motor's datasheet or markings
# for its degrees-per-step rating (200 steps assumes 1.8 degrees per
# step; a 7.5-degrees-per-step motor would need 48).
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Target position math
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Before wiring this into the main loop, test target_position() in
# the REPL with a few hand-picked values to build confidence in the
# formula:
#
# Example code:
#
# print(target_position(0))                        # 0 - the very start of a cycle
# print(target_position(ROTATION_PERIOD_MS // 2))   # STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION // 2 - halfway around
# print(target_position(ROTATION_PERIOD_MS))        # 0 - a full cycle has elapsed, wraps back to start
#
# Confirm each result makes sense before continuing - a full
# revolution's worth of elapsed time should return to position 0,
# and half a revolution's worth of time should return roughly half
# of STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Running state
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the TODO in STATE_RUNNING. Test with a short
# ROTATION_PERIOD_MS first (try 10000, a 10-second revolution) so you
# do not need to wait long to see a complete rotation. Confirm the
# motor moves smoothly and completes a full revolution in
# approximately the expected time - some timing error is normal,
# since MIN_STEP_DELAY and STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION together set a
# maximum possible stepping rate, and very short ROTATION_PERIOD_MS
# values may not be achievable if they would require stepping faster
# than MIN_STEP_DELAY allows.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Stop and resume
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Test SW5 mid-rotation and confirm the motor stops immediately and
# de-energises (you should be able to turn the shaft by hand with
# light resistance). Wait several seconds, then press SW2 to resume,
# and confirm the motor steps forward more quickly than normal for a
# moment as it catches up to the current target, then settles back
# into its normal rate. This catch-up behaviour is expected - review
# the STOPPED description in the header comment if it is not clear
# why.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6 - Set your real rotation period
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Once everything works correctly, set ROTATION_PERIOD_MS to the
# value that matches your actual application (60000 for a
# seconds-hand-like motion, or a much longer period for a slow
# display turntable) and do a final full-length test run.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Bidirectional movement
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This capstone only ever steps forward, since its target position
# always advances predictably with elapsed time. A turntable that
# needs to move to an arbitrary requested position (rather than
# following a predictable cycle) might sometimes be closer to its
# target by stepping backward instead. Implement a step_backward()
# function (hint: it uses the same four phases in reverse order) and
# a decision in STATE_RUNNING about which direction is shorter to a
# requested target position.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Preset positions
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Instead of continuous rotation, adapt this project into a display
# turntable that steps between a fixed set of preset positions,
# pausing at each - reusing the parallel-list pattern from Simon Game
# and Animatronic Controller for a list of target positions and a
# list of pause durations.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Half-step sequence
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The sequence in this project is a full-step sequence (four phases,
# both coils always energised). An eight-phase half-step sequence
# (alternating between both coils energised and just one) doubles the
# effective resolution and produces smoother motion, at the cost of
# somewhat reduced torque. Look up the half-step phase sequence for a
# bipolar stepper and implement it as eight phases instead of four -
# you will need a way to leave one coil unenergised for some phases,
# which left_motor_stop()/right_motor_stop() already provide.
# Remember to update SEQUENCE_LENGTH and STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION (which
# will roughly double) to match.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Speed ramping
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Stepper motors can stall if commanded to start at full speed
# instantly, especially with any real load attached. Add gradual
# acceleration at the start of a run and deceleration when
# approaching a stop, rather than moving at a constant MIN_STEP_DELAY
# throughout. What happens to a real motor's reliability, and to how
# "realistic" the motion looks, with and without ramping?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Manual position display
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a periodic Serial printout showing current_position as a
# fraction of STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION - for example, as a percentage
# around the circle, or converted to a clock-style "hours and
# minutes" if ROTATION_PERIOD_MS represents a 12-hour cycle. This
# makes it possible to follow the motor's tracked position without
# watching the physical shaft.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 6 - Use the freed-up headers
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Since this project leaves H1-H4 completely free, add a sensor or
# input device that the wheeled-robot capstones could not spare a
# header for - a light sensor to detect when a display turntable
# should stop rotating and pause on a spotlit item, for example, or a
# button that jumps straight to a specific position rather than
# waiting for the rotation cycle to reach it naturally.
