# Capstone Project: Animatronic Servo Controller [Animatronic_Controller.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# A three-servo animatronic puppet that plays back a pre-authored
# sequence of poses, looping continuously. The example sequence below
# animates a simple head - panning left and right, tilting, and
# opening and closing a jaw - but the same structure works for any
# combination of servos: a waving arm, blinking eyelids, a wagging
# tail. Adapt the example sequence to your own puppet design.
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2          - Start playback
#   SW5          - Emergency stop (halts playback, holds current pose)
#   LS1          - Piezo speaker (start beep) - see EA3 for animated sound
#   On-board LED - On while playing
#
#   Servo 1 on H5 - Example: head pan (left/right)
#   Servo 2 on H6 - Example: head tilt (up/down)
#   Servo 3 on H7 - Example: jaw/mouth (open/close)
#
# NOTE: unlike BEAPER Nano, BEAPER Pico's H5, H6, and H7 are dedicated
# servo pins, not shared with H1-H4 - so there is no pin conflict to
# worry about if you extend this project with an external sensor.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How the animation sequence works:
#
# Four lists, indexed together, describe the sequence - the same
# parallel-list pattern from Simon Game's BUTTONS/LEDS/TONES, extended
# from three lists to four. Frame i of the animation is described by
# ANIM_SERVO1[i], ANIM_SERVO2[i], ANIM_SERVO3[i], and ANIM_HOLD[i]
# together:
#
#   ANIM_SERVO1[i] - servo 1's angle during frame i
#   ANIM_SERVO2[i] - servo 2's angle during frame i
#   ANIM_SERVO3[i] - servo 3's angle during frame i
#   ANIM_HOLD[i]   - how long frame i is held before advancing (ms)
#
# Playback moves all three servos to frame i's angles, waits
# ANIM_HOLD[i] milliseconds, then advances to frame i+1 - wrapping
# back to frame 0 after the last frame, so the sequence loops
# continuously. See Development Guide Step 1 before editing the
# sequence.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Animatronic controller behaviour:
#   IDLE    - Servos at HOME_ANGLE. Press SW2 to begin playback.
#   PLAYING - Cycling through the animation sequence, looping forever.
#   STOPPED - Playback halted, servos hold their current pose exactly
#             where they were. Press SW2 to return to IDLE (servos
#             then move to HOME_ANGLE).
#
# Before you begin - complete your capstone plan using the Capstone
# Preparation Guide: a plain-English description of your puppet and
# what it does, a list of your servos and what each one moves, your
# planned sequence of poses, and your testing plan.

# Development Guide

#
# Work through these steps in order. Test each servo individually
# before combining them into a sequence.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Understanding the parallel-list sequence
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This capstone reuses the parallel-list pattern from Simon Game's
# BUTTONS, LEDS, and TONES - three separate lists, indexed together,
# where index i across all three lists describes one complete "thing"
# (one button/LED/tone combination). Here, four lists play the same
# role for one animation frame instead:
#
# Example code:
#
# ANIM_SERVO1[2]  # servo 1's angle during frame 2
# ANIM_SERVO2[2]  # servo 2's angle during frame 2
# ANIM_SERVO3[2]  # servo 3's angle during frame 2
# ANIM_HOLD[2]    # how long frame 2 is held (ms)
#
# All four values at index 2 together describe "frame 2" of the
# animation, the same way BUTTONS[2], LEDS[2], and TONES[2] together
# described "Simon colour 2." An alternative design could combine
# each frame into a single tuple - (servo1, servo2, servo3, hold) -
# stored in one list of tuples instead of four separate lists. Both
# work; four parallel lists keeps each individual list simple and
# reuses exactly the pattern Simon Game already introduced, without
# adding a new nested structure on top of it.
#
# Trace through frame 2 in the example sequence by hand: what angle
# is each servo at, and how long is that pose held before the
# sequence moves on to frame 3?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Servo wiring and range verification
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Verify each servo moves correctly and confirm which physical
# movement each angle produces for your specific puppet mechanism.
# Temporarily add these lines after set_pose(HOME_ANGLE, HOME_ANGLE,
# HOME_ANGLE) near the top of the program:
#
# Example code:
#
# time.sleep_ms(1000)
# beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, 0)
# time.sleep_ms(1000)
# beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, 90)
# time.sleep_ms(1000)
# beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, HOME_ANGLE)
#
# Repeat for SERVO2 and SERVO3. Note which angle corresponds to which
# physical position (e.g. "20 degrees = head fully left") - you will
# need these reference points when designing your own sequence in
# Step 5. Remove the test lines once you have confirmed all three
# servos move as expected.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Playback from IDLE
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the TODO in STATE_IDLE. Test that pressing SW2 correctly
# moves all three servos to frame 0's pose and transitions to
# STATE_PLAYING. Check the Serial Monitor for the state transition.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Sequence playback
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the TODO in STATE_PLAYING. Test that the puppet cycles
# through all six example frames in order, holding each for the
# correct duration, and loops back to frame 0 after the last frame.
# Test the emergency stop (SW5) mid-sequence and confirm the servos
# freeze in place rather than snapping to any other position. Test
# that pressing SW2 from STOPPED returns to HOME_ANGLE and IDLE.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Design your own sequence
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Using the angle reference points you recorded in Step 2, design and
# write your own ANIM_SERVO1/ANIM_SERVO2/ANIM_SERVO3/ANIM_HOLD lists
# for your own puppet concept. Remember to update NUM_FRAMES to match
# the new list lengths - what happens if NUM_FRAMES does not match?
# Test your sequence and adjust hold times and angles until the
# motion looks the way you intend.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Smooth motion between poses
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The base sequence snaps instantly from one pose to the next, which
# can look mechanical. Implement smooth motion instead: rather than
# calling set_pose() once per frame, step each servo gradually from
# its previous angle to the new frame's angle over a short
# TRANSITION_TIME, using the same "elapsed time since last step ->
# advance by a small amount" repeating-timer pattern used elsewhere
# in this curriculum (Activity 12's alarm flash, for example). You
# will need to track each servo's current angle separately from its
# target angle. Does smooth motion change how long each frame's total
# hold time should be?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Fourth servo
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# BEAPER Pico only has three dedicated servo channels (SERVO1-3, H5-H7)
# - H8 is wired to the piezo speaker (LS1) instead of a fourth servo.
# If your puppet design needs a fourth servo, you will need to
# construct your own PWM object on a spare header the same way
# BEAPER Nano's version of this project does, or free up H1-H4 for
# use with an external servo driver board. What did you need to
# change in how many places to add one more servo? At what number of
# servos would you want a different structure - see Analog Monitor's
# EA5 for a similar tradeoff in a different context.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Synchronized sound
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a fifth parallel list, ANIM_TONE, giving each frame a tone
# frequency (or 0 for silence). Play the tone (or call
# beaper.noTone()) each time a new frame begins, alongside the servo
# movement. Try syncing a tone with the jaw-open frames in the
# example sequence for a simple "talking" effect. Real animatronic
# characters often go further, syncing individual mouth shapes to
# recorded speech - what would be needed to approximate that with
# only two mouth positions (open/closed)?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Interactive recording
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a RECORDING state where SW3/SW4 adjust the angle of a
# currently-selected servo (cycle which servo is selected with a
# third button), and SW2 captures the current pose as a new frame,
# appending it to the sequence rather than requiring the sequence to
# be hand-written in code ahead of time. You will need mutable lists
# built up one frame at a time (starting empty and growing with each
# capture) rather than the fixed-length lists used here - similar to
# how Simon Game's sequence list grows one step at a time, but built
# from live servo positions instead of random button choices.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Random idle behaviour
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Instead of holding perfectly still in STATE_IDLE, add small random
# movements (a slight head tilt, an occasional blink) every few
# seconds while waiting for SW2, so the puppet appears "alive" even
# before playback starts. How would you keep these idle movements
# from interfering with a press of SW2 to begin the real sequence?
