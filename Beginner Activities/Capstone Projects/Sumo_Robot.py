Capstone Project: Sumo Robot [BEAPER_Pico-Capstone_Sumo_Robot.py]
April 28, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (Robot configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Hardware used:
    SW2        - Start match (begins countdown then releases robot)
    SW5        - Emergency stop (halts from any state)
    LS1        - Piezo speaker (countdown beeps, state feedback tones)
    On-board LED - Status indicator (on while armed/running)

    Q1 (JP1=Robot) - Left floor sensor (ring-edge detection)
    Q3 (JP3=Robot) - Right floor sensor (ring-edge detection)
    SONAR on H2/H3 - Ultrasonic distance sensor (opponent detection)

    Motor 1 (M1A/M1B) - Left drive motor
    Motor 2 (M2A/M2B) - Right drive motor

IMPORTANT - Jumper settings for Robot mode:
    JP1 = Robot   (connects Q1 left floor sensor to ADC0)
    JP2 = Robot   (optional: connects Q2 centre sensor to ADC1)
    JP3 = Robot   (connects Q3 right floor sensor to ADC2)

IMPORTANT - LED / motor pin sharing:
    LED2-LED5 share pins with the motor driver. The LEDs cannot be
    used while the motors are running, but instead show motor states.

Sensor wiring:
    Mount the SONAR module on headers H2 (TRIG) and H3 (ECHO).
    Mount Q1 (left) and Q3 (right) floor sensors at the front-left and
    front-right corners of the robot. The ring boundary (typically white
    tape on a dark surface, or dark tape on a light surface) will produce
    a sudden change in the Q1/Q3 readings as the sensor crosses the line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sumo robot behaviour:

    IDLE      - Robot stationary. Press SW2 to begin the match.
                LED2-LED5 flash in a sequence to show the robot is ready.
                SW5 does nothing (already stopped).

    COUNTDOWN - Mandatory pre-match delay (START_DELAY ms). During this
                time the robot is stationary. The speaker counts down
                with beeps. Motors do not move.

    SEARCH    - No opponent within DETECT_RANGE cm. Robot executes a
                slow rotation to sweep the SONAR across the ring.
                If SONAR detects an opponent, transition to PUSH.
                If a floor sensor trips, transition to EDGE.

    PUSH      - Opponent detected within DETECT_RANGE cm. Robot drives
                forward at full speed to push the opponent out.
                SONAR is checked continuously: if opponent disappears
                (pushed out or dodged), return to SEARCH.
                If a floor sensor trips, transition to EDGE immediately.

    EDGE      - A floor sensor has detected the ring boundary. Robot
                backs up for BACKUP_TIME ms, then turns away from the
                detected edge for TURN_TIME ms, then returns to SEARCH.
                Edge detection is the highest-priority condition and
                interrupts any other state immediately.

    STOPPED   - Motors halted. Match ended, emergency stop pressed, or
                error state. Press SW2 to return to IDLE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin - complete your capstone plan:
    1. Write a plain-English description from the robot's perspective:
       what does it sense, what does it decide, what does it do?
    2. List all states and draw your state diagram with transitions.
    3. Complete the state details table (outputs, transitions, next states).
    4. List all constants and variables you will need.
    5. Write your testing plan - test each sensor and motor independently
       before combining them into state logic.

Capstone Development Guide

Work through these steps in order. Never attach the robot to a surface
during motor testing unless you are certain of the motor directions -
motors can drive the robot off a table unexpectedly. Test on the floor
or hold the robot clear of any surface.

Step 1 - Sensor calibration
    Before writing any state logic, calibrate your sensors. Add temporary
    print statements after the startup sensor check to print readings in
    a loop:

        while True:
            print("Q1:", beaper.Q1_level(), "Q3:", beaper.Q3_level(),
                  "SONAR:", beaper.sonar_distance_cm(), "cm")
            time.sleep_ms(100)

    Place the robot on the ring surface and note the Q1 and Q3 readings.
    Move the robot to the boundary tape and note the change. Set
    EDGE_THRESHOLD to a value midway between the two readings. Test with
    the same lighting conditions you will use during the match.

    For SONAR, hold an object at 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm and verify the
    readings are consistent. Set DETECT_RANGE to comfortably less than
    the ring diameter.

Step 2 - Motor direction verification
    Verify motor directions before connecting to drive wheels. Call each
    motor function individually and confirm that "forward" moves the robot
    in the intended direction:

        beaper.left_motor_forward()
        time.sleep_ms(500)
        beaper.motors_stop()

    If a motor runs backward, swap its wiring on CON1 (the motor terminal
    block) rather than changing the code. Both motors should drive the
    robot forward when left_motor_forward() and right_motor_forward() are
    called together.

Step 3 - Edge detection response
    Test STATE_EDGE in isolation before combining with other states.
    Temporarily enter STATE_EDGE from IDLE and confirm the robot backs
    up, then turns in the correct direction for each edge_direction value.
    Walk the robot to each edge of the ring and verify the correct
    edge_direction is printed.

Step 4 - Search behaviour
    With edge detection working, test STATE_SEARCH. The robot should spin
    in place and transition to PUSH when an object is held within
    DETECT_RANGE. Verify it returns to SEARCH when the object is removed.
    Adjust the spin direction if needed by swapping left_motor_forward()
    and right_motor_reverse() in the SEARCH state.

Step 5 - Full match cycle
    Run the complete state machine from IDLE through COUNTDOWN to SEARCH.
    Watch the serial monitor to confirm state transitions print correctly.
    Test the emergency stop (SW5) from SEARCH and PUSH. Test the return
    to IDLE from STOPPED.

Step 6 - Extensions and strategy improvements

    a) Proportional SONAR steering: in STATE_PUSH, if the opponent
       moves slightly to one side, correct course by briefly slowing
       one motor while continuing to drive forward. To detect sideways
       movement, take two SONAR readings in quick succession while
       rotating slightly left and right, and compare which direction
       gives the shorter reading. This is a simplified radar sweep.

    b) Floor sensor ring check in PUSH: if both floor sensors read the
       ring surface consistently, you are in a safe central position.
       If one sensor reads lower (approaching an edge) during a push,
       steer away from that side. This prevents chasing the opponent
       all the way to your own edge.

    c) Search strategy improvement: simple spin-in-place misses an
       opponent who mirrors your rotation. Add a STATE_ADVANCE that
       drives forward for a short burst between search sweeps, forcing
       position changes that break the mirror pattern.

    d) Battery monitoring: Vsys_Volts() reads the Pico's input voltage
       directly in volts. Low battery causes erratic motor behaviour
       that can look like software bugs. Print the voltage at startup
       and periodically during the match. Add a low-battery warning
       (beep and slow flashing LED) if the reading drops below a
       threshold you determine experimentally.

    e) Match timer: real sumo matches have a time limit. Add a
       MATCH_DURATION constant and transition from any active state to
       STATE_STOPPED when the time since COUNTDOWN ended exceeds
       MATCH_DURATION. Print the match duration to the serial monitor
       when the match ends.
