Capstone Project: Line Follower Robot [BEAPER_Pico-Capstone_Line_Follower.py]
April 28, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (Robot configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Hardware used:
    SW2        - Start following (begins immediately, no countdown)
    SW5        - Emergency stop (halts from any state)
    LS1        - Piezo speaker (start beep, line-lost alert)
    On-board LED - Status indicator (on while running)

    Q2 - Left line sensor  (R sensor module, left position)
    Q3 - Right line sensor (R sensor module, right position)
    Q1 - Line sensor (L sensor module, for alternate configurations)

    Motor 1 (M1A/M1B) - Left drive motor
    Motor 2 (M2A/M2B) - Right drive motor

IMPORTANT - Jumper settings for two-sensor line following:
    JP2 = Robot   (connects Q2 to ADC1 - left sensor)
    JP3 = Robot   (connects Q3 to ADC2 - right sensor)
    JP1 = Robot   (used in alternate configurations)

IMPORTANT - LED / motor pin sharing:
    LED2-LED5 share pins with the motor driver. The LEDs cannot be
    used while the motors are running, but instead show motor states.

Sensor module setup - two-sensor configuration (starting point):
    Install the R sensor module ('Line/Floor', labelled 'R') on the
    robot's centreline. The module contains two phototransistors: Q2 in
    the left position, and Q3 in the right position. When centred on the
    line, both Q2 and Q3 'see' the line. This works well for following
    a simple tape line (20mm or 3/4" electrical tape works well).

    This program follows a dark line on a light surface (e.g. black tape
    on a white floor). Sensors return higher values on the light surface
    and lower values over the dark line. Calibrate LINE_THRESHOLD to a
    value midway between your two surfaces. If your course uses a light
    line on a dark surface, invert the comparisons in read_sensors().

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other sensor arrangements (see capstone development guide, below):

    Two-sensor floor detection (wider lines, T-stops, + intersections):
      Use two sensor modules, with the 'L' module on the robot's right,
      and the 'R' module on the robot's left. Q3 becomes the left sensor
      and Q1 becomes the right sensor, with both sensors detecting the
      floor on either side of the line. Update read_sensors() to read
      Q1_level() and Q3_level().

    Three-sensor row (narrower lines, sharper curves):
      Use two sensor modules, with the 'L' module on the robot's right,
      and the 'R' module on the robot's left, aligning the three
      phototransistors in an equally-spaced row: Q2 detects the left of
      a wide line or the floor to the left of a narrow line, Q3 detects
      the centre of the line, and Q1 detects the right of a wide line
      or the floor to the right of a narrow line. This gives three
      independent sensors and enables the priority-based steering used
      in the three-sensor TODO blocks in the capstone development guide.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line follower behaviour:
    IDLE      - Robot stationary. Press SW2 to begin following.
                Motors off. SW5 does nothing (already stopped).

    FOLLOW    - Two-sensor differential steering:
                  Q2 on line only -> turn left
                  Q3 on line only -> turn right
                  Both on line                    -> drive straight
                  Neither on line                 -> line lost, enter RECOVER

    RECOVER   - Line lost. Robot rotates opposite the last-known turn
                direction for RECOVER_TIME ms to sweep back across the
                line. If the line is found again, return to FOLLOW
                immediately. If RECOVER_TIME elapses without finding
                the line, try the changing to the opposite direction
                for RECOVER_TIME ms. If still not found, transition to
                STOPPED.

    STOPPED   - Motors halted. Press SW2 to return to IDLE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin - complete your capstone plan:
    1. Write a plain-English description of the robot's following behaviour.
    2. Draw the state diagram with all transitions.
    3. Complete the state details table (outputs, transitions, next states).
    4. List all constants and variables you will need.
    5. Write your testing plan - test each sensor individually before
       testing the complete following behaviour.

Capstone Development Guide

Work through these steps in order. Test on the floor and hold the robot
clear of any surface when testing motor directions for the first time.

Step 1 - Sensor calibration
    Before any state logic, calibrate your line sensors. Add a temporary
    calibration loop after the startup sensor check:

        while True:
            print("Q2:", beaper.Q2_level(), "Q3:", beaper.Q3_level())
            time.sleep_ms(100)

    Hold each sensor over the light surface and note the readings, then
    over the dark tape. Set LINE_THRESHOLD to a value comfortably midway
    between the two. A good threshold leaves a clear gap on both sides
    so that minor lighting variation does not trigger false readings.

    If your course uses a light line on a dark surface, change the
    comparisons in read_sensors() from < to >.

Step 2 - Motor direction verification
    Verify motor directions before driving on a course:

        beaper.left_motor_forward()
        time.sleep_ms(500)
        beaper.motors_stop()

    If a motor runs backward, swap its wiring on CON1. Both motors should
    drive the robot forward when both are set to forward.

Step 3 - Straight-line following
    Place the robot centred on the line and verify that STATE_FOLLOW
    drives it straight with both sensors triggering. Print the sensor
    flags each loop iteration (call print_sensors() temporarily) and
    confirm that both left_on_line and right_on_line are True when centred.

Step 4 - Steering corrections
    Test each steering correction on a gentle curve. Confirm that:
    - The robot turns left when only Q2 (left) triggers
    - The robot turns right when only Q3 (right) triggers
    If the corrections are in the wrong direction, verify that JP2 and
    JP3 are both set to Robot and that Q2 and Q3 are reading correctly.

Step 5 - Recovery
    Test STATE_RECOVER by lifting the robot off the line mid-follow and
    placing it back. Confirm it finds the line and returns to FOLLOW.
    Test the two-attempt recovery by placing the robot away from the line
    and verifying it transitions to STOPPED after both attempts fail.

Step 6 - Complete course
    Run the robot on a closed loop. Watch the serial monitor for state
    transitions. A well-tuned robot should stay in STATE_FOLLOW for the
    entire lap except when recovering from sharp curves.

Step 7 - Sensor configuration extensions

    a) Two-sensor floor detection (wider lines, T-stops, + intersections):
       Swap the L and R sensor modules: place the R module ('Line/Floor')
       on the robot's LEFT side and the L module ('Floor') on the RIGHT
       side. Q3 (R module, now on the left) becomes the left floor sensor,
       and Q1 (L module, now on the right) becomes the right floor sensor.
       Set JP1=Robot and JP3=Robot. In read_sensors(), change the left
       sensor to Q3_level() and the right sensor to Q1_level().

       In this arrangement both inboard phototransistors detect the floor
       on either side of the line rather than the line itself. The robot
       follows by keeping floor on both sides (both sensors off the line).
       This arrangement handles wider lines, T-junctions, and + intersections
       more reliably than the narrow-line two-sensor approach.

       TODO: update read_sensors() for floor detection:
         left_on_line  = beaper.Q3_level() < LINE_THRESHOLD  (floor = low)
         right_on_line = beaper.Q1_level() < LINE_THRESHOLD
       Invert the steering logic: if both sensors are HIGH (on the floor),
       drive straight. Correct when one sensor goes LOW (over the line).

    b) Three-sensor row (narrower lines, sharper curves, intersections):
       Swap the L and R sensor modules and align the three phototransistors
       in a row across the front of the robot:
         Q2 (R module, left position)  - left of line
         Q3 (R module, right position) - centre, on the line
         Q1 (L module, left position)  - right of line
       Set JP1=Robot, JP2=Robot, JP3=Robot.

       This gives a true three-sensor arrangement where Q3 tracks the line
       centre and Q2/Q1 detect drift to either side. Priority-based
       steering becomes possible: outer sensors (Q2, Q1) take priority over
       the centre sensor (Q3), and the robot can detect intersections when
       all three trigger simultaneously.

       TODO: update read_sensors() for three-sensor mode:
         left_on_line   = beaper.Q2_level() < LINE_THRESHOLD  (Q2: left)
         centre_on_line = beaper.Q3_level() < LINE_THRESHOLD  (Q3: centre)
         right_on_line  = beaper.Q1_level() < LINE_THRESHOLD  (Q1: right)
       Update the steering logic in STATE_FOLLOW to use all three flags:
         if left_on_line and not right_on_line:   turn left
         elif right_on_line and not left_on_line: turn right
         else:                                    drive straight

    c) Speed gradient using PWM: rather than stopping a motor for
       corrections, reduce its duty cycle proportionally. This produces
       smoother following and reduces oscillation on straight sections.
       Investigate how to set PWM duty cycle on motor pins using
       beaper.M1A.duty_u16() and compare the result to the binary approach.

    d) Lap counter: increment a counter each time both sensors trigger
       simultaneously for more than MARKER_TIME ms without having been at
       a recovery event recently. Print the lap count and lap time each lap.

    e) Course map: record each steering correction as a direction and
       elapsed time since the previous correction. After one lap, print
       the map to the serial console. Can you predict the course layout
       from the map?
