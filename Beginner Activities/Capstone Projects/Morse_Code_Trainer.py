# Capstone Project: Morse Code Trainer [Morse_Code_Trainer.py]
# Version: 1.0
# Updated: July 25, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# Practice sending and receiving Morse code using a single button.
# Hold SW2 briefly for a dot, longer for a dash - the same tap/hold
# timing idea from Activity 11, applied to classify each press rather
# than just detecting a hold.
#
# Two modes, selected with SW3/SW4 at the menu:
#
#   TRANSMIT - Free practice. Tap out letters at your own pace; each
#              completed letter is decoded and printed as soon as you
#              pause. No pressure, no scoring - just practice forming
#              correct dot/dash patterns.
#
#   RECEIVE  - The program picks a random letter and sends it back to
#              you (LED2 flashes, LS1 beeps - a dot is a short flash,
#              a dash is three times as long). You then tap the same
#              letter back using the identical tap interface, and the
#              program checks whether it matches.
#
# Both modes rely on the exact same underlying mechanism - reading
# taps, classifying each as a dot or dash, and detecting when a
# letter is complete from the pause that follows it. That shared
# logic lives in one function, read_tap(), that both modes call.
#
# Hardware used:
#   SW2          - Tap button (hold briefly for a dot, longer for a dash)
#   SW3 / SW4    - Cycle mode (only while at the menu)
#   SW5          - Start / return to menu
#   LED2         - Lights while SW2 is held, and during RECEIVE's playback
#   LS1          - Piezo speaker (tap tone, playback tone)
#
# Compatible with all BEAPER Pico configurations. No additional
# hardware or jumper changes required.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Timing (see Development Guide Step 1 for calibration):
#   DOT_MAX_MS    - a press shorter than this is a dot; longer is a dash
#   LETTER_GAP_MS - a pause longer than this after a release, with no
#                   new press, means the letter is complete
#
# Real Morse timing uses fixed ratios: a dash is three dot-durations
# long, the gap between letters is three dot-durations, and the gap
# between words is seven. This trainer uses similar proportions but
# with more forgiving absolute values, since tapping accurately by
# hand is harder than a machine sending at a fixed rate.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Trainer behaviour:
#   MENU           - Select mode with SW3/SW4. Press SW5 to begin.
#   TRANSMIT       - Continuous free-form tapping and decoding.
#                    Press SW5 to return to the menu.
#   RECEIVE_SEND   - The program sends a random letter.
#   RECEIVE_LISTEN - Your turn - tap back the same letter.
#   RECEIVE_RESULT - Shows whether you matched it, then starts
#                    another round automatically.
#
# Before you begin - complete your capstone plan using the Capstone
# Preparation Guide: a plain-English description of each mode, a
# state diagram, your constants and variables, and your testing plan.

    #
    # TODO: implement this function using the following steps:
    #
    # 1. Read SW2's current state. Compare it against sw2_was_pressed
    #    (tracking the PREVIOUS reading) to detect edges - the same
    #    pattern used for SW3/SW4 in STATE_MENU below.
    #
    # 2. On a press edge (was not pressed, now is): record
    #    press_start = current_time. Update sw2_was_pressed.
    #
    # 3. On a release edge (was pressed, now is not): calculate how
    #    long the press lasted (current_time - press_start). If shorter
    #    than DOT_MAX_MS, append '.' to current_sequence; otherwise
    #    append '-'. Record last_release_time = current_time and set
    #    letter_pending = True. Update sw2_was_pressed.
    #
    # 4. Regardless of the above, check: if letter_pending is True AND
    #    SW2 is not currently pressed AND the time since
    #    last_release_time is at least LETTER_GAP_MS, the letter is
    #    complete. Save current_sequence into a local variable, reset
    #    current_sequence = "" and letter_pending = False, and return
    #    the saved sequence.
    #
    # 5. If none of the above produced a completed sequence, return
    #    None.
    #
    # Think carefully about step 4's ordering relative to steps 2-3 -
    # should the gap check happen before or after processing a
    # press/release edge that occurs on the very same call?

# ================================================================================
# Development Guide
# ================================================================================
#
# Work through these steps in order.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Calibrate the timing constants
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Before implementing anything, get a feel for DOT_MAX_MS and
# LETTER_GAP_MS by tapping naturally on SW2 while printing raw press
# durations. Temporarily add this loop after beaper.LED2.value(0)
# near the top of the program:
#
# Example code:
#
# while True:
#     if beaper.SW2.value() == 0:
#         press_start = time.ticks_ms()
#         while beaper.SW2.value() == 0:
#             pass
#         duration = time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_ms(), press_start)
#         print("press duration:", duration, "ms")
#
# Tap several short presses and several deliberately longer ones.
# Choose a DOT_MAX_MS value comfortably between your typical short
# and long presses - not guessed, measured. Remove the test loop
# once you have a value that feels right.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Implement read_tap()
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is the core mechanism the whole trainer depends on - both
# modes call it. Implement it following the TODO steps in its
# definition. Test it in isolation before moving on: temporarily call
# it every loop iteration from STATE_MENU and print whatever it
# returns, then tap out a few letters by hand and confirm the raw
# sequences look right (dots and dashes in the order and count you
# expect) before worrying about whether they decode to the correct
# letter.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Understand RECEIVE_SEND
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# STATE_RECEIVE_SEND is already complete - read through it before
# implementing RECEIVE_LISTEN. It uses the same flash-then-gap
# sub-phase pattern as Rock-Paper-Scissors's countdown: sending_on
# tracks whether LED2/LS1 are currently active for the symbol at
# symbol_index, and symbol_duration is calculated per-symbol (a dash
# takes DASH_MULTIPLIER times as long as a dot to send) rather than
# being a single fixed value.
#
# Run the program, select RECEIVE, and press SW5. Confirm a random
# letter is sent - watch and listen for a pattern of short and long
# flashes with gaps between them, and check the Serial Monitor for
# which letter was chosen so you can verify what you saw matches.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Transmit mode
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the TODO in STATE_TRANSMIT. Test by selecting TRANSMIT
# and tapping out several different letters, confirming each is
# decoded correctly after you pause. Deliberately tap an invalid
# sequence (five dots in a row, for example) and confirm it prints
# '?' rather than crashing or hanging.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Receive listening and comparison
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Implement the TODO in STATE_RECEIVE_LISTEN. Test by selecting
# RECEIVE and correctly tapping back several letters the program
# sends, then deliberately tapping the wrong letter back at least
# once, confirming both outcomes are detected and reported correctly.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6 - Full session
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Play several RECEIVE rounds in a row and confirm each automatically
# starts the next after RESULT_DISPLAY_MS, and that pressing SW5
# during RECEIVE_RESULT returns to the menu instead. Switch between
# TRANSMIT and RECEIVE at the menu and confirm both still work
# correctly after switching back and forth.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - External Morse key
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A real Morse key (a straight key, specifically - the classic
# spring-loaded lever switch) is far more tactile and authentic to
# practice on than a small tactile button. Wire one to H1 as a
# second momentary switch input, using the same pull-up pattern as
# Combination Safe's door sensor:
#
# Example code:
#
# from machine import Pin
# key_switch = Pin(beaper.H1_PIN, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
#
# Rather than choosing between SW2 or the external key, let both work
# at once - replace every beaper.SW2.value() == 0 check inside
# read_tap() with a call to a small helper function:
#
# Example code:
#
# def tap_pressed():
#     return beaper.SW2.value() == 0 or key_switch.value() == 0
#
# This sidesteps needing any kind of input-source setting entirely.
# With no external key wired up, key_switch simply reads "released"
# permanently via its own pull-up, so nothing breaks or needs
# toggling - SW2 keeps working exactly as before. With a key
# connected, either one taps out dots and dashes interchangeably,
# even switching between them mid-session.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - Full words and phrases
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a third mode where RECEIVE sends a whole word instead of a
# single letter - each letter of the word sent in turn, with a
# WORD_GAP_MS-length pause (rather than SYMBOL_GAP_MS) marking the
# boundary between letters within the word so the player can tell
# where one letter ends and the next begins. Build your own word
# list (a simple list of short, all-uppercase strings works well -
# add your own words to it) and pick one at random the same way
# target_letter is currently chosen from MORSE_LETTERS. The player
# must tap back the entire word, letter by letter, matching
# read_tap()'s per-letter completion against the word's letters in
# order.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Numbers and punctuation
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Extend MORSE_LETTERS and MORSE_CODES with entries for 0-9 (and
# punctuation, if you like) rather than building a separate lookup
# mechanism - the existing decode_letter()/encode_letter() functions
# work unchanged with a longer table, since they already search the
# whole list rather than assuming exactly 26 entries. Remember to
# update NUM_LETTERS to match the new table length.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Adjustable speed (WPM)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Morse speed is conventionally measured in words per minute (WPM),
# based on a standard word length. Add a speed setting (adjustable
# with SW3/SW4 at the menu, similar to how mode is currently
# selected) that scales DOT_MAX_MS, LETTER_GAP_MS, SYMBOL_GAP_MS, and
# RECEIVE_SEND's dot duration all together from one WPM value, rather
# than as independent constants. What relationship between WPM and
# dot duration would you use? (Hint: research the standard "PARIS"
# timing method real operators use to define WPM precisely.)
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - SOS recognition
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Real operators send SOS as a single continuous prosign - three
# dots, three dashes, three dots, with no letter-gap pauses between
# the S, O, and S - rather than as three separately-decoded letters.
# In read_tap()'s terms, this means the full sequence "...---..."
# arrives as ONE completed sequence, not three. Add a check (in
# either TRANSMIT or RECEIVE, or both) for this exact sequence, and
# trigger a distinct, attention-grabbing alarm response when
# detected - reusing Alarm System's aesthetic seems fitting for
# something that is, after all, the universal distress signal.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 6 - Audio-only or visual-only practice
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Real Morse operators work by sound alone - add a setting (cycled
# at the menu alongside mode) that makes RECEIVE_SEND use only LS1,
# only LED2, or both together, letting a player practice pure audio
# reception once they no longer need the visual flash as a crutch.
