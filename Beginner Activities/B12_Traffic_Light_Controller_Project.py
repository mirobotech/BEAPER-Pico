# ================================================================================
# Project: Traffic Light Controller [B12_Traffic_Light_Controller_Project.py]
# Version: 1.2
# Updated: September 22, 2026
#
# Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
# Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file
#
# Before starting this project, re-read GE 1 through GE 7 from
# Activity 12: State Machines. This skeleton reuses the same
# enter_state() and named-constant patterns as the combination lock,
# now applied to a four-state traffic light.
#
# State diagram:
#   RED --(RED_TIME elapsed, car_waiting)     --> ADV_GREEN
#   RED --(RED_TIME elapsed, not car_waiting) --> GREEN
#   ADV_GREEN --(ADV_GREEN_TIME elapsed)      --> GREEN
#   GREEN     --(effective green time elapsed)--> YELLOW
#   YELLOW    --(YELLOW_TIME elapsed)         --> RED
#
# Outputs per state:
#   RED:        LED5 on
#   ADV_GREEN:  LED5 on (cross traffic still stopped) + LED2 flashing
#               (protected left-turn arrow)
#   GREEN:      LED3 on
#   YELLOW:     LED4 on
#
# Simulated inputs (SW2/SW3 are only read during RED):
#   SW2: simulates a car waiting for the protected left turn -
#        sets 'car_waiting', which is checked once, when RED_TIME
#        elapses, to decide whether to enter ADV_GREEN or GREEN
#   SW3: simulates a pedestrian crossing request - sets
#        'walk_requested', which extends the following GREEN phase
#        by WALK_EXTENSION milliseconds
#
# Unlike the combination lock, where each button press needed to be
# counted individually, SW2 and SW3 here just need to be noticed at
# any point during RED - so this project checks them with the same
# plain 'beaper.SW2.value() == 0' comparison used since Activity 3,
# with no release-waiting required. A flag, once set, stays set until
# the state machine resets it on the next entry to RED.

# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Complete the skeleton
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Complete the four TODO sections above so the traffic light
# cycles correctly. Test each transition by watching the serial
# output and LEDs: does RED always last at least RED_TIME? Does
# holding SW2 during RED correctly route through ADV_GREEN? Does
# a walk request measurably lengthen the following GREEN phase?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - A second pedestrian button
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a second walk request button, SW4, for pedestrians crossing
# in the opposite direction, with its own 'walk_requested_2' flag.
# Either request should extend GREEN - but pressing both should
# not extend it twice. How will your condition check for "at
# least one of the two flags is set" without double-counting?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - All-red clearance interval
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Real traffic lights often include an all-red clearance interval
# - a brief period where every direction shows red, after YELLOW
# and before the next phase begins, to let the intersection fully
# clear before cross traffic gets a green light. Add a new
# ALL_RED state between YELLOW and RED, lasting ALL_RED_TIME
# milliseconds, with every LED off except LED5.
#
# Update your state diagram to include this new state and its
# transitions.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - Pedestrian countdown warning
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Add a pedestrian countdown warning: when GREEN has less than
# 3000ms of its calculated duration remaining, flash LED3 instead
# of holding it steady, to warn that the light is about to change.
# You will need to compare 'elapsed' against
# 'calculate_green_time() - 3000' rather than a fixed constant.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Time-driven vs. event-driven transitions
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This traffic light and the combination lock both use
# 'enter_state()', named state constants, and 'time.ticks_diff()'
# for timing - but they differ in one significant way: the
# combination lock's transitions all depend on button presses,
# while most of this traffic light's transitions depend on
# elapsed time instead, with button presses only setting flags
# checked later.
#
# Look back at your state diagrams for both programs. Which
# transitions in each diagram are triggered by time, and which by
# an event? Is there a state in either program with more than one
# way to leave it?
