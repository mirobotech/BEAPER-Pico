Project: Combination Lock [B12_Combination_Lock_Project.py]
April 14, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Before starting, re-read GE1, GE2, and GE3 from
Activity 12: State Machines.

This skeleton implements a three-button combination lock as a
state machine. The correct combination is SW2, SW3, SW4 pressed
in sequence. Any wrong button press triggers the alarm state.
SW5 resets from any state.

State diagram:
  LOCKED --> (SW2 correct) --> STEP_1
  STEP_1 --> (SW3 correct) --> STEP_2
  STEP_2 --> (SW4 correct) --> UNLOCKED
  Any state --> (wrong button) --> ALARM
  Any state --> (SW5)        --> LOCKED

Outputs per state:
  LOCKED:   LED2 on (locked indicator)
  STEP_1:   LED2 + LED3 on (one correct press)
  STEP_2:   LED2 + LED3 + LED4 on (two correct presses)
  UNLOCKED: LED5 on, short beep (access granted)
  ALARM:    LED2-LED5 flashing rapidly, repeated beeps (alarm)

Extension Activities

1.  The UNLOCKED state currently does nothing useful after the
    lock opens - LED5 stays on indefinitely. Implement a re-lock
    mechanism: SW5 must be held for RESET_HOLD_TIME milliseconds
    to re-lock. Use the 'button_is_down' and 'button_down_time'
    pattern from Activity 11.

    Why require a hold rather than a tap to re-lock? Think about
    what would happen in a real access-control system if the door
    accidentally re-locked while someone was passing through.

2.  Add a lockout after three failed attempts. Declare an
    'attempt_count' variable that increments each time the lock
    transitions to ALARM from any step state. After three failed
    attempts, enter a LOCKOUT state that ignores all input for
    LOCKOUT_TIME milliseconds before returning to LOCKED.

    Add LOCKOUT to your state diagram and identify the new
    transitions. How does this change the security of the lock
    compared to the version with no lockout?

3.  Make the combination configurable. Store the correct sequence
    as a tuple:

  COMBINATION = (beaper.SW2, beaper.SW3, beaper.SW4)

    Rewrite the state machine to work with any length combination
    stored in this tuple, using a 'step' index variable instead of
    separate STEP_1 and STEP_2 states. How does the number of
    states in the new design compare to the original? What are
    the tradeoffs of the two approaches?

4.  Consider how this combination lock could form the arm/disarm
    mechanism for a security alarm capstone project. What would
    the full system's state diagram look like, including:
    - Disarmed state (lock is open, sensors ignored)
    - Arming state (countdown delay while you leave)
    - Armed state (sensors active)
    - Triggered state (alarm sounding)
    - Each combination lock state for disarming

    Draw the complete state diagram. How many states does the
    full system have? How does the lock's state machine nest
    inside the alarm system's state machine?
