# # Guided Exploration
#
# Guided exploration (GE) activities and questions highlight the key ideas
# introduced in the program. In a classroom, instructors can use them to
# guide discussion, demonstration, prediction, and troubleshooting.
# Independent learners can use the guided exploration activities as
# checkpoints to test their understanding before moving on.
#
# This first beginner activity introduces the basic structure of
# MicroPython programs. In certain guided exploration activities, you'll
# be asked to modify or add code to the starter program presented above.
#
# The contents of this entire comment block are formatted in Markdown
# syntax - with the exception of the very first comment pound # tag at
# the start of every line (these are just regular MicroPython comments).
# To extract these guided exploration and extension activities sections
# into a Markdown file, highlight the text in these sections and select
# `Toggle comment` from the `Edit` menu in Thonny.
#
# Example program code will be presented like this:
#
# **Example code:**
# ```python
# beaper.LED2.value(1)
# ```
#
# Double-asterisks are Markdown syntax for bold text, so a Markdown editor
# would display the words `Example code:` bolded. The three backtick (```)
# characters, often followed by a language description like `python` or
# `cpp` are used to format code blocks, making it stand out. They are not
# part of the code, so when you need to copy the example text, just select
# the lines of text between the sets of backtick. In this example the code
# being referenced is the single line instruction: `beaper.LED2.value(1)`.
#
# Words shown in single backticks within the guided exploration sections,
# like `LED2`, are also code - they show you the exact spelling and
# capitalization to use. Are you ready to start exploring? Let's go!
#
# ## GE 1 - Comments and program statements
#
# Most computer programs contain both text comments (which help anyone
# reading the program code to understand it) and the actual program
# statements that the microcontroller will run or execute.
#
# Comments in MicroPython follow a pound sign `#`, meaning everything that
# follows a pound sign in a line of text will be ignored.
#
# In the starter program, most of the text is comments. How does the
# MicroPython editor you're using treat the comments differently from the
# actual program code?
#
# ## GE 2 - Importing the board module
#
# The first real program statement encountered in this program imports a
# board module file for your BEAPER Pico circuit.
#
# **Example code:**
# ```python
# import BEAPER_Pico as beaper
# ```
#
# The `BEAPER_Pico.py` board module file must be copied into the filesystem
# memory of the microcontroller before this program runs. If the file is not
# present when the import statement runs, an error will be generated, and an
# error message will be printed in the shell window below.
#
# The `BEAPER_Pico.py` board module file contains ordinary MicroPython
# program code that defines and configures BEAPER Pico's I/O devices and
# microcontroller pins for you, helping you to start writing programs more
# quickly. You can open the board module file in the code editor to explore
# all of the code it contains.
#
# The board module file includes the names and pin numbers of all I/O
# devices on the circuit, including `LED2`. This lets program statements,
# like the one below, use the name `LED2` to control its operation
# instead of us needing to know the pin number LED2 is connected to.
#
# **Example code:**
# ```python
# beaper.LED2.value(1)
# ```
#
# Let's break this statement down: the `BEAPER_Pico` board module has been
# given the shorter name `beaper` by the import statement, and `LED2` is
# one of the objects defined in the `BEAPER_Pico` board module file.
# MicroPython's `value` method is used to read or set pin values, so the
# end result of the microcontroller running this statement is that the
# value of the `LED2` pin gets set to `1`, meaning the output voltage of the
# pin connected to LED2 is set to around 3.3V, which will turn LED2 on.
#
# All of BEAPER Pico's other LEDs (`LED2` - `LED5`) can be controlled in
# exactly the same way. Let's try it.
#
# Add a second LED output statement to light LED3 below the existing
# statement that lights LED2. Run the updated program to verify that it
# works as expected.
#
# ## GE 3 - Sequential execution
#
# MicroPython runs every program by reading, interpreting, and executing
# each program statement, in order, from the top of the program code to the
# bottom.
#
# So, after adding the statement `beaper.LED3.value(1)` below the existing
# `beaper.LED2.value(1)` statement in GE 2, the microcontroller will turn
# LED2 on first, followed by LED3. Though these two actions take place
# sequentially, they happen so fast that, to us at least, it looks like both
# LEDs turn on simultaneously.
#
# ## GE 4 - The main program loop
#
# If all that we wanted the program to do was to turn two LEDs on, it could
# end after these two statements have run. In reality, microcontroller
# programs usually don't end. Instead, they continue running the task they
# were designed to do over and over again in what is called a main program
# loop.
#
# In MicroPython programs, the `while True:` structure is the most common
# method used to create a main program loop. Any statements indented by the
# same amount below the `while True:` line will be repeated forever.
#
# Indentation is very important in MicroPython, and program editors will
# try to help you indent your program code in a consistent way - let them!
# If two or more program statements that are meant to be in the same code
# structure use different amounts of space characters to indent their code,
# the MicroPython interpreter will generate an error due to the mismatch.
# You will often run into this problem when copying and pasting code
# examples from different sources.
#
# Would it make sense to put the `beaper.LED2.value(1)` output statement
# inside the `while True:` loop? Why or why not? What would the program be
# trying to do if the statements used to turn on the LEDs were moved into
# the `while True:` loop?
#
# ## GE 5 - The pass statement
#
# The `pass` statement in the main `while True:` loop prevents MicroPython
# from generating an error due to the otherwise empty loop. Comment out the
# pass statement by placing a pound sign in front of the `pass` keyword.
# Then, try to run the program.
#
# **Example code:**
# ```python
# # pass
# ```
#
# Since MicroPython interpreters ignore the rest of any line of text
# following a pound sign, the pass statement will now be ignored. 
# What do you think the word `pass` actually does? How might `pass`
# be helpful to us later?
#
# ## GE 6 - Fast output changes
#
# Let's try to blink LED3 on and off. Replace the contents of the main
# `while True:` loop with two statements: one to turn the LED on, followed
# by a second one to turn the LED off.
#
# **Example code:**
# ```python
# while True:
#   beaper.LED3.value(1)  # LED3 on
#   beaper.LED3.value(0)  # LED3 off
# ```
#
# Since these two statements are now inside the main loop, `pass` is no
# longer needed. The loop will run each statement once, first turning LED3
# on, and then turning LED3 off. After that, the loop will repeat from the
# top, turning LED3 on again, and then off again... forever.
#
# Run the program and observe LED3. Is LED3 on, off, or flashing? What
# should be happening? Is it? How could you test your prediction?


# # Extension Activities
#
# Extension activities give learners a chance to apply the concepts and
# ideas presented in the guided exploration activities in new contexts,
# or as new challenges. Instructors may assign selected extensions for
# practice, enrichment, or assessment. Independent learners can use them
# to help solidify understanding and to apply their skills.
#
# ## EA 1 - Turn LED2 on and off
#
# The statement used to turn LED2 on in the starter program runs before
# the main while: loop. What do you think will happen if this statement
# is immediately followed by a second statement to turn LED2 off?
#
# Try it! Do you see LED2 turning on and then off? Explain what is happening
# and why you think this happens.
#
# ## EA 2 - Reverse the statement order
#
# Predict what will happen if the order of the two LED2 statements in EA 1
# is reversed so that LED2 is turned off first, and then turned on.
#
# Try it! Does the state of LED2 match your prediction?
#
# ## EA 3 - Create an LED pattern
#
# Create a program that lights a pattern by illuminating at least two of the
# on-board LEDs. Run your program to verify that it works as expected.
#
# ## EA 4 - Use the microcontroller module LED
#
# The `BEAPER_Pico.py` board module file includes functions to control the
# Raspberry Pi Pico module's on-board LED, as well as many other pin
# definitions and pre-made functions for the BEAPER Pico circuit. (Feel
# free to open the file to explore all of the code that it contains.)
#
# One of the functions in the BEAPER Pico board module is used to turn on
# the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller's on-board LED:
#
# **Example code:**
# ```python
# beaper.pico_led_on()
# ```
#
# Add this function call at the very beginning of your program so that
# the Raspberry Pi Pico's LED can act as a status indicator to show that
# your program is running even if none of the BEAPER Pico's on-board LEDs
# are lit. Run the program to verify that it works.
