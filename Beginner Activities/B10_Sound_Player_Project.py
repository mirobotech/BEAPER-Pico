Project: Sound Player [B10_Sound_Player_Project.py]
March 31, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Before starting this project, re-read GE1 and GE3
from Activity 10: Analog Output.

This project sets up the BEAPER Pico's piezo speaker as a PWM
output with independent control over frequency and duty cycle.
Frequency determines pitch - higher values produce higher pitches.
Duty cycle determines the tone's character (timbre) - a 50% duty
cycle produces a clean square wave, while lower duty cycles produce
a thinner, more nasal sound.

Controls:
    SW2 - decrease frequency (lower pitch)
    SW5 - increase frequency (higher pitch)
    SW3 - decrease duty cycle (thinner sound)
    SW4 - increase duty cycle (fuller sound)

Extension Activities

1.  Implement the 'beep()' function and use it to play a startup
    chime when the program begins - three rising tones of decreasing
    duration, for example. Call 'beep()' from before the main loop
    so the chime plays once on startup, then the interactive
    controls take over.

    After the chime, does the speaker resume at the correct
    frequency and duty cycle? What do you need to call after
    'beep()' to restore the continuous tone?

2.  A melody can be stored as a sequence of (frequency, duration_ms)
    pairs. Here is a short example using the first four notes of
    'Ode to Joy':

  melody = (
    (659, 400),   # E5
    (659, 400),   # E5
    (698, 400),   # F5
    (784, 400),   # G5
  )

    The following code plays the melody one note at a time using
    'beep()'. Add it after your startup chime:

  for note in melody:
    beep(note[0], duty, note[1])
    time.sleep_ms(50)             # Short gap between notes

    Extend the melody with more notes, or create your own. Change
    the gap between notes and observe how it affects the feel of
    the music. What happens if you change 'duty' to a low value
    like 'int(65535 * 0.05)' before playing the melody?

3.  Add a silence mode toggled by pressing SW2 and SW5 at the same
    time. When silent, 'beaper.LS1.duty_u16(0)' stops the tone
    without changing 'frequency' or 'duty'. Pressing either button
    alone while silent resumes the tone at the stored settings.
    How will you detect that two buttons are pressed simultaneously?

4.  Investigate how 'beaper.tone()' from the board module differs
    from directly setting 'beaper.LS1.freq()' and
    'beaper.LS1.duty_u16()'. Open BEAPER_Pico.py and read the
    'tone()' function. What duty cycle does it always use? Could
    you produce the full range of timbres available in this project
    using 'beaper.tone()' alone, or does exploring timbre require
    direct PWM access as used here?
