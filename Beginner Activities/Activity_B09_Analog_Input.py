# ================================================================================
# Guided Exploration
# ================================================================================
#
# All of the programs so far have used digital I/O - inputs and outputs
# that are either fully on or fully off. The real world is rarely that
# simple: temperature, light, sound, and position all vary continuously
# across a range of values. Microcontrollers read these continuously
# varying physical quantities using an Analog to Digital Converter, or
# ADC, which turns a voltage into a number the program can work with.
#
# The functions in this program apply the patterns from Activity 8 -
# parameters, return values, and encapsulation - to sensor data,
# converting raw ADC readings into bar graph displays and musical
# tones. This activity also works with integer and float numeric
# types in detail - the Numeric Types sidebar is a useful reference if
# you want to review how these types work.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 1 - ADC resolution and range
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The Raspberry Pi Pico's RP2040 ADC uses the read_u16() method to
# return values from 0 to 65535 - a 16-bit range. This means readings
# are scaled to divide the full input voltage range (0 to 3.3V) into
# 65536 steps, giving an apparent resolution of about 0.05mV per step.
# The physical ADC resolution is only 12 bits, or about 0.8mV per
# step. Using 16-bit results enables analog algorithms to easily
# scale when future devices have higher ADC resolution.
#
# The board module's analog helper functions return these raw
# ADC values directly. When you turn RV1 fully anti-clockwise,
# 'RV1_level()' returns approximately 0. Fully clockwise returns
# approximately 65535. Observe the console while slowly rotating
# RV1 from one extreme to the other. Is the change perfectly
# smooth, or do you notice any irregularities?
#
# Why do you think the ADC uses a range of 0-65535 specifically,
# rather than 0-100 or 0-1000? Think about how 65536 relates to
# powers of 2 and the binary number system from Activity 7. The
# Numeric Types sidebar explains why integer sizes are always
# powers of 2.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 2 - map_range() and float division
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The 'map_range()' function converts a value from one numeric
# range to another:
#
# Example code:
#
# def map_range(value, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max):
#   return out_min + (value - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min)
#
# Trace through this formula with value=32767 (approximately
# halfway), in_min=0, in_max=65535, out_min=200, out_max=4000.
# What frequency would this produce? Does it match what you
# would expect for a value halfway through the input range?
#
# Notice that the function uses '/' rather than '//'. This means
# it returns a float - a number with a decimal point. The main
# loop wraps the result in 'int()' before passing it to 'tone()':
#
# Example code:
#
# frequency = int(map_range(rv2, 0, 65535, TONE_MIN, TONE_MAX))
#
# Why is the 'int()' conversion necessary here? Try removing the
# 'int()' conversion and observe what happens - does the result
# match what you would predict? You'll explore why types matter for
# hardware functions like 'tone()' in GE 5, below.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 3 - show_bar() and integer division
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The 'show_bar()' function divides the LED range into four
# bands, with thresholds centred in each quarter:
#
# Example code:
#
# beaper.LED2.value(1 if level > max_level * 1 // 8 else 0)
# beaper.LED3.value(1 if level > max_level * 3 // 8 else 0)
# beaper.LED4.value(1 if level > max_level * 5 // 8 else 0)
# beaper.LED5.value(1 if level > max_level * 7 // 8 else 0)
#
# The thresholds are at 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, and 7/8 of max_level -
# the midpoints of each quarter. This means each LED represents
# one quarter of the input range, and all four LEDs can light
# when the value is high enough.
#
# Trace through the function with max_level=65535 and these
# values of level: 0, 8192, 24576, 40960, 57344, 65535.
# Which LEDs are lit for each value?
#
# The '//' operator is integer division - it divides and discards
# any remainder, always returning a whole number. This is the
# opposite of '/' which, as you will explore in GE5, always
# returns a float. Using '//' here keeps the threshold
# calculations as integers, which is appropriate since LED pin
# values and ADC counts are always whole numbers.
#
# Notice the operator precedence: 'max_level * 1 // 8' is
# evaluated as '(max_level * 1) // 8' rather than
# 'max_level * (1 // 8)'. Try evaluating '1 // 8' on its own
# in the console. What result do you get, and what would happen
# to 'show_bar()' if the division were performed first?
#
# Compare 'show_bar()' with 'indicate_attempts()' from
# Activity 8. Both display a level on four LEDs, but
# 'show_bar()' works with any maximum value, not just 4.
# What did making the function more general require, and what
# did it make possible?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 4 - Continuous tone and blocking functions
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Part 2 maps RV2 to a tone frequency, creating a theremin-like
# instrument. The tone plays continuously because 'beaper.tone()'
# is called without a duration argument - it starts the tone and
# returns immediately, leaving the tone running until something
# stops it.
#
# Open BEAPER_Pico.py and re-read the 'tone()' and 'noTone()'
# functions you examined in Activity 8. Under what conditions
# does 'tone()' call 'noTone()' automatically? If 'tone()' is
# called without a duration, what is the only way to stop the
# tone?
#
# The function 'read_keypad()' from Activity 8 is not suitable
# for use inside a loop that needs to keep updating sensor
# readings and tone frequency. What property of 'read_keypad()'
# would cause problems here? Think about what the function does
# while it is waiting for a button press.
#
# Modify the main loop to silence the tone while SW5 is held
# down, using 'beaper.SW5.value() == 0' as the check and
# 'beaper.noTone()' to stop the sound. The tone should resume
# automatically on the next iteration when SW5 is released.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 5 - The MicroPython console as a live interpreter
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The MicroPython console is more than just a place to see
# output from 'print()' - it is a live interpreter that evaluates
# any MicroPython expression you type directly. This makes it a
# powerful tool for exploring how the language works.
#
# Stop the running program by pressing Ctrl-C. The console will
# show a '>>>' prompt, indicating that it is ready to accept
# expressions directly. Type each of the following one at a time
# and press Enter after each. Record what you see:
#
# Example code:
#
# 10 / 2
# 10 // 2
# print(10 / 2)
# print(10 // 2)
# print(type(10 / 2))
# print(type(10 // 2))
# print(type(200))
# print(type(3.3))
# x = 65535
# print(x * 3.3 / 65535)
# print(type(x * 3.3 / 65535))
#
# MicroPython has two main numeric types: 'int' (whole numbers)
# and 'float' (numbers with a decimal point). The '/' operator
# always produces a float, even when the result is a whole
# number. The '//' operator always produces an int, discarding
# any remainder.
#
# This matters for hardware functions. Using the console, try:
#
# Example code:
#
# import BEAPER_Pico as beaper
# beaper.tone(1000)
# beaper.tone(1000.0)
#
# What difference do you observe? This is why 'map_range()'
# returns a float but the main loop converts it to int before
# passing it to 'beaper.tone()'.
#
# When you are finished exploring, press Ctrl-D or reset the
# board to restart the program.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 6 - Reading the die temperature sensor
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Unlike BEAPER Nano, which has a separate external temperature
# sensor (U4), BEAPER Pico has no dedicated ambient temperature
# sensor. Instead, this program calls 'beaper.mcu_temperature()',
# which reads the RP2040 chip's own internal die temperature
# sensor - a feature built into the microcontroller itself.
#
# Open BEAPER_Pico.py and find 'mcu_temperature()'. Unlike
# 'read_temp_c()' in the BEAPER Nano version of this activity,
# you won't derive this conversion yourself - the underlying
# physics (a biased diode's voltage changing predictably with
# temperature) is more abstract than a dedicated sensor's
# datasheet curve, so the board module provides this one ready
# to use. Still, read through its comments and code carefully:
#
# According to the comment, what voltage does the sensor produce
# at 27 degrees C? What happens to the voltage as temperature
# rises - does it increase or decrease? At what raw ADC value
# would the formula compute exactly 27 degrees C? Calculate it
# and verify by adding a temporary print statement.
#
# This sensor measures the temperature of the RP2040 chip's own
# silicon, not the surrounding air. The chip generates heat while
# it runs, and busier code generates more heat than idle code.
# Would you expect 'mcu_temperature()' to read higher than, lower
# than, or the same as the actual room temperature? Is there
# anything you could add to this circuit to get a genuinely
# accurate ambient temperature reading? (Think back to why BEAPER
# Nano has a separate external sensor for this instead of relying
# on its own die temperature.)
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 7 - Calibrating sensor thresholds
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Before tuning the threshold values for the hysteresis light
# detector that will be created in GE8, below, it helps to know
# the actual range of values the light sensor produces in your
# environment. Hysteresis is a technique that uses two thresholds -
# one to turn something on, and a lower one to turn it off - to
# prevent flickering when a reading hovers near a single boundary.
# GE8 covers this in detail; first, take some measurements to
# calibrate the thresholds to your environment.
#
# Temporarily add two variables before the main loop to track
# the minimum and maximum light readings seen so far:
#
# Example code:
#
# light_min = 65535
# light_max = 0
#
# Inside the main loop, after reading 'light', add:
#
# Example code:
#
# if light < light_min:
#   light_min = light
# if light > light_max:
#   light_max = light
# print("Min:", light_min, "Max:", light_max)
#
# Run the program and slowly cover Q4 completely with your
# finger, then uncover it fully and hold it near a bright
# light source. Record the minimum and maximum values you
# observe. These represent the practical range of your sensor
# in its current environment.
#
# Remove the tracking code once you have your readings. You
# will use these values to set appropriate LIGHT_HIGH and
# LIGHT_LOW thresholds in GE8.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 8 - Hysteresis
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A single threshold would turn the status LED on when light
# exceeds it and off when light falls below it - but when the
# light level hovers near the boundary, the LED flickers
# rapidly as the reading crosses the threshold many times
# per second.
#
# Hysteresis solves this with two thresholds: the LED turns
# on only when light rises above LIGHT_HIGH, and turns off
# only when it falls below LIGHT_LOW. The gap between them
# creates a band of values where the LED holds its current
# state regardless of small fluctuations.
#
# The 'light_on' variable is declared before the main loop,
# not inside it. Why is this essential to the hysteresis
# behaviour? What would happen if 'light_on = False' were
# inside the loop?
#
# Using the minimum and maximum readings from GE7, set
# LIGHT_HIGH to approximately 75% of the way between your
# minimum and maximum, and LIGHT_LOW to approximately 25%.
# Slowly cover and uncover Q4 while watching the status LED.
# Does the LED respond without flickering near the transition?
#
# Reduce the gap between LIGHT_HIGH and LIGHT_LOW gradually
# until flickering begins. What is the minimum gap that prevents
# flickering under your lighting conditions? What happens if
# you set LIGHT_LOW higher than LIGHT_HIGH?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GE 9 - Formatting console output
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The main loop prints all sensor readings on a single line
# using 'end=""' to suppress the normal newline after each
# print, with a final newline at the end of the iteration:
#
# Example code:
#
# print("RV1:", rv1, end="  ")
# ...
# print("Light LED:", light_on)
#
# This keeps each loop iteration on one line in the console,
# making it easier to observe all values changing together.
#
# Add a loop counter variable that increments on each iteration
# and prints at the start of each line (e.g. "1:", "2:"...) to
# make it easier to correlate readings across iterations.
#
# Observe the rate at which lines appear. What STEP_DELAY value
# gives the best balance between a fast sensor update rate and
# output that is readable? Human perception has a limit of around
# 50-100ms - below that threshold, reducing STEP_DELAY further
# will not make the sensor response feel more immediate, but the
# console output will become harder to read.


# ================================================================================
# Extension Activities
# ================================================================================
#
# These activities build on the sensor-reading and function patterns
# from the starter program. Use named constants for all threshold and
# scaling values, and named functions for any reusable behaviour.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 1 - Inverted bar graph with default parameters
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Modify 'show_bar()' so that it accepts an optional third
# argument 'invert' that defaults to False. When invert is True,
# the bar fills from right to left - LED5 lights first at low
# values, LED2 last at high values. Use this to display the
# light level inverted, so that a darker environment produces
# a fuller bar.
#
# MicroPython supports default parameter values in functions:
#
# Example code:
#
# def show_bar(level, max_level, invert=False):
#
# Call 'show_bar(light, 65535, invert=True)' for the light
# display and verify it responds correctly. What does this tell
# you about how default parameters make functions more flexible
# without requiring changes to existing calls?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 2 - temp_trend()
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write a 'temp_trend()' function that compares the current
# temperature with the previous reading and returns the string
# 'rising', 'falling', or 'steady'. Store the previous reading
# in a variable declared before the main loop. Print the trend
# alongside the current temperature on each iteration.
#
# What threshold difference in degrees C makes a useful 'steady'
# band that avoids constant switching due to sensor noise? Since
# 'mcu_temperature()' measures the chip's own die temperature,
# try adding a busy loop (for example, a few thousand extra
# iterations of a pointless calculation) right before reading the
# temperature. Does the reading change, even though the room
# temperature hasn't? What does this tell you about using this
# sensor to track slow ambient temperature changes?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 3 - Data logger
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Create a data logger that records the minimum and maximum
# values seen for RV1, the light level, and temperature since
# the program started. Print the current value, minimum, and
# maximum for each sensor on every iteration. When SW5 is
# pressed, reset all minimums and maximums to their starting
# values.
#
# Think carefully about initial values: what should the minimum
# start at so that the first real reading always replaces it?
# What should the maximum start at? What happens to your
# approach if the sensor range is not known in advance?
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 4 - calibrate(sensor_fn, samples)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write a 'calibrate(sensor_fn, samples)' function that calls
# a sensor function 'samples' times with a short delay between
# readings, discards the highest and lowest values, and returns
# the average of the remainder as a float. The first argument
# should be a function - for example, 'beaper.RV1_level' (without
# brackets, so the function itself is passed, not its result).
#
# Call this function once at startup for RV1 and the light
# sensor, storing the results as baseline values. In the main
# loop, display the difference between the current reading and
# the baseline rather than the raw value.
#
# Hint: in MicroPython you can pass a function as an argument
# and call it inside the receiving function. Here is the basic
# structure showing how to call the passed-in sensor function
# and accumulate readings - the trimming and averaging logic is
# yours to implement:
#
# Example code:
#
# def calibrate(sensor_fn, samples):
#   total = 0
#   for _ in range(samples):
#     total += sensor_fn()      # Call the passed-in function
#     time.sleep_ms(10)
#   # Add trimming and return the average here
#
# This technique - averaging after discarding the extremes - is
# called a trimmed mean, and it reduces the effect of occasional
# noisy readings on the result. This is also a preview of
# functions as first-class values - a concept covered in full
# in the intermediate activities.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EA 5 - Environmental monitor
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Build a simple environmental monitor using the available analog
# inputs. Display die temperature in degrees C and light as a
# percentage of the calibrated maximum. Use RV1 to set a
# temperature alarm threshold and RV2 to set a light alarm
# threshold. When either sensor exceeds its threshold, sound
# a distinctive alarm tone and flash the corresponding LED.
#
# Structure the program using functions for each major task:
# reading and converting each sensor, checking each threshold,
# and triggering each alarm. How does organising the program
# this way compare to writing it as a single sequential block?
# What would make it harder to add a third sensor later?
