Project: Servo Controller [B10_Servo_Controller_Project.py]
March 31, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (any configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Before starting this project, re-read GE1 and GE3
from Activity 10: Analog Output.

IMPORTANT - How servo PWM differs from LED and motor PWM:

For LEDs and motors, the duty cycle (proportion of on-time) is
what matters. The PWM frequency can vary within a wide range.

For hobby servos, position is encoded differently: the servo
expects a pulse of a specific width, repeated at a fixed rate.
The standard is a 50 Hz signal (one pulse every 20ms), with the
pulse width varying to encode position:

For 90 degree travel servos:
    - 1.0ms pulse width = full anti-clockwise (~0 degrees)
    - 1.5ms pulse width = centre position (~45 degrees)
    - 2.0ms pulse width = full clockwise (~90 degrees)

For 180 degree travel servos:
    - 0.5ms pulse width = full anti-clockwise (~0 degrees)
    - 1.5ms pulse width = centre position (~90 degrees)
    - 2.5ms pulse width = full clockwise (~180 degrees)

Servo connector locations on BEAPER Pico:
    H5 - Servo channel 1 (use beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, angle))
    H6 - Servo channel 2 (use beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO2, angle))
    H7 - Servo channel 3 (use beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO3, angle))

Note: H8 shares the piezo buzzer pin and is not available as a
servo output while the buzzer is active.

Controls:
    RV1 - servo 1 position (0-90 degrees, if pots installed)
    RV2 - servo 2 position (0-90 degrees, if pots installed)
    SW2/SW5 - servo 1 step anti-clockwise/clockwise (if no pots)
    SW3/SW4 - servo 2 step anti-clockwise/clockwise (if no pots)

Extension Activities

1.  Open BEAPER_Pico.py and read the 'set_servo()' function and
    the three constants above it: 'SERVO_MIN_US', 'SERVO_MAX_US',
    and 'SERVO_RANGE'.

    Trace through 'set_servo()' with angle=0, angle=45, and
    angle=90. What pulse width in microseconds does each produce?
    Do the results match the 1.0ms, 1.5ms, and 2.0ms values
    described in the header above?

    The function uses 'servo.duty_ns()' rather than
    'servo.duty_u16()'. Why is expressing the pulse in nanoseconds
    more direct for servo control than expressing it as a duty
    cycle percentage? At 50 Hz (20ms period), what duty_u16 value
    would correspond to a 1.5ms pulse - calculate it and compare
    with the 4915 initialisation value used in the board module.

    Try calling 'beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, 0)',
    'beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, 45)', and
    'beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, 90)' directly from the
    console while the program is stopped. Observe the servo
    position for each call and confirm it matches the calculated
    pulse widths.

2.  Write a 'sweep(servo, start_angle, end_angle, step_ms)'
    function that moves a servo smoothly from start_angle to
    end_angle, pausing step_ms milliseconds between each degree
    of movement. Use it to create a scanning motion - sweep from
    0 to 90 and back continuously.

    Note that 'sweep()' uses 'time.sleep_ms()' internally, which
    blocks the main loop for its full duration. How would you
    allow two servos to sweep simultaneously? This is the problem
    Activity 11's non-blocking timing solves.

3.  Implement a servo sequencer: define a sequence of (angle,
    dwell_ms) pairs representing positions and how long to hold
    each one. Write a function that steps through the sequence,
    moving the servo to each angle and waiting the specified time.

    Example sequence for a simple pick-and-place arm:

  sequence = (
    (10, 800),    # Move to pick position
    (60, 1500),   # Move to carry position
    (90, 400),    # Move to place position
    (60, 500),    # Return to carry position
  )

    The following code steps through the sequence, sets SERVO1's
    position, and waits for the dwell time:

  for step in sequence:
    beaper.set_servo(beaper.SERVO1, step[0])
    time.sleep_ms(step[1])

4.  Research the pulse width range for the specific servo you are
    using. Many servos accept a wider range than the standard
    1.0-2.0ms, allowing more than 90 degrees of travel. Look in
    BEAPER_Pico.py for constants that set the servo pulse width
    limits and try adjusting them. What happens if the pulse width
    exceeds the servo's mechanical limits?
