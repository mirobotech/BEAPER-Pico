Project: Motor Controller [B10_Motor_Controller_Project.py]
March 31, 2026

Platform: mirobo.tech BEAPER Pico circuit (robot configuration)
Requires: BEAPER_Pico.py board module file.

Before starting this project, re-read GE1, GE2, GE3,
and GE4 from Activity 10: Analog Output.

IMPORTANT HARDWARE NOTES:
    The H-bridge motor driver outputs share pins with LED2-LED5.
    Using this project will prevent LED2-LED5 from being used as
    status indicators - the PWM objects created here replace the
    LED Pin objects from the board module on those pins.

    Motor wiring (standard robot configuration):
        M1A / M1B - Left motor
        M2A / M2B - Right motor

    The H-bridge driver requires motor power to be connected
    separately from the logic supply. Ensure motor power is
    connected before running motors. Never exceed the driver
    chip's rated current per channel.

    Always test motor direction at low speed (25%) before
    increasing to full speed. If a motor runs the wrong direction,
    swap its two wires at the motor terminal.

This project configures both H-bridge channels as PWM outputs
and provides a left_motor() speed control function and right_motor()
and motors() function skeletons for you to finish implementing.
Speed is given as a percentage from -100 (full reverse) to 100
(full forward), with 0 as stopped.

Controls:
    RV1 - left motor speed  (clockwise = reverse, anti-clockwise = forward)
    RV2 - right motor speed (anti-clockwise = reverse, clockwise = forward)
    SW5 - enable/disable drive (safety enable switch)

Extension Activities

1.  BEAPER Pico will need to be powered using either a power supply
    or a battery pack connected to the CON1 screw terminal strip to
    run the motors. Test the program with one motor connected to the
    left motor terminals. Finish the right_motor() and motors()
    functions in the program and test them to make sure they work.

2.  Add acceleration limiting so that motor speed changes gradually
    rather than jumping to the target immediately. Store the current
    speed for each motor in a variable and move it toward the target
    by a fixed step per loop iteration. What step size gives a
    natural-feeling acceleration without making the robot feel
    sluggish?

3.  Implement a 'drive_timed(left_speed, right_speed, duration_ms)'
    function that drives both motors at the given speeds for a set
    duration, then stops. Use it to create a simple repeatable
    movement sequence - forward, turn, forward, stop.

    Note that 'drive_timed()' blocks the main loop for its full
    duration using 'time.sleep_ms()'. Activity 11 introduces
    non-blocking timing that allows other actions to continue
    during a timed movement.

4.  Four-pump or four-fan controller: the H-bridge driver can
    control four independent single-direction loads (pumps, fans)
    by wiring each load between one motor output pin and ground.
    Reconfigure the motor PWM objects for the type of load that
    will be controlled:

  PUMP1_PWM = PWM(Pin(beaper.LED2_PIN), freq=1000, duty_u16=0)
  PUMP2_PWM = PWM(Pin(beaper.LED3_PIN), freq=1000, duty_u16=0)
  PUMP3_PWM = PWM(Pin(beaper.LED4_PIN), freq=1000, duty_u16=0)
  PUMP4_PWM = PWM(Pin(beaper.LED5_PIN), freq=1000, duty_u16=0)

    Use SW2-SW5 to enable each pump independently and RV1 to set
    a shared duty cycle (flow rate). Add a maximum run time per
    pump to prevent overheating or as a safety measure to prevent
    a storage tank overflow.
